					<p>You received a message on your cabin phone earlier in the day. It was from

					<p>You're familiar with several regulars in this industry, but his name does
						not ring a bell. His room number is 437.</p>
					<p>You gave Bernard a call after receiving the message. Bernard said that he

					<p>"35C" the combination keeps rolling through your head. It sounds like a room
						number, but in reality it could mean anything so you have to approach this
						with gentle hands (at least at first).</p>
					<p>You decide to prepare for the trip up to the room, so you head back to your
						cabin and prepare. A knife goes in your coat pocket along with a heavy
						flashlight that looks big enough to club a moose.</p>
					<p>You're ready so you make the journey up to the room. You tell yourself that
						you're just going to spec out the room, but in reality you're not quite sure
						what you'll do. "Think sharp. Stay focused." you tell yourself to keep you
						in a hyper aware mode. Soon you find yourself on level C.</p>
					<p>As you walk by the room you notice something on the ground. It looks like a
						ring. You pick it up for a closer inspection. The ring is a cheap knock-off
						wedding ring made to look like a fortune.</p>
					<p>Examining it a bit closer you realize that you've seen this ring before. In
						fact it came in a matching set and you're wearing the other half of that
						set! This was Sarah's ring!!</p>
					<p>You approach the door and can hear movement in the room. Knocking you hear
						someone get up and walk toward the door. A large man opens the door. Making
						up a quick story you ask the man if he has experienced any problems with the
						phone service. You tell him that you're just down the hall.</p>
					<p>He gives you a look over quickly and says with a heavy European accent
						"Don't I know you?". Your taken a bit aback by this as you have never met
						the man before in your life.</p>
					<p>Your heart starts to pound as you realize that you're already in deaper than
						you had hoped. No turning back now.</p>
					<p>Hearing a noise coming from inside the room, it sounds like a random tapping
						of some sort. The rhythmic tapping seems to remind you of something
						familiar. An epiphany hits you like a shot of adrenalin into your heart,
						it's Morse Code! "HELP"</p>
					<p>Your body moves before your brain knows what's happening and you smash the
						man's nose with your fist and push your way into the room. The thug drops
						cold to the floor caught completely off guard by you immediately and fierce
						strength.</p>
					<p>You open the washroom and find a woman tied up and in the bathtub knocking
						on the wall with her foot.</p>
					<p>"Sarah!" You untie her and she forces herself onto her feet, unsteady as she
						rises. You both make your way out of the room but with no clear direction
						other than away from where you are.</p>
					<p>As you make your way out of the room you see a flash from behind a corner.
						Then a ghost moves quickly from the corner. Madeline... She motions for you
						both to follow her which you do into the darkness of the crew passageways.</p>
					<p>Snaking through the passageway Madeline moves quickly and assuredly. Finally
						she opens a door leading back to a passenger area. You find yourself right
						in front of Bernard's cabin.</p>
					<p>Knocking on Bernard's door he soon opens it and is shocked to see Sarah
						standing there with you. He grabs Sarah and hugs her. The reunion is cut
						short by Madeline who motions for you to keep going quickly.</p>
					<p>Only you can see Madeline and you realize that you must translate her
						directions so that Bernard and Sarah can follow.</p>
					<p>"Bernard we are not alone here!" you tell him. He gets the drift of what you
						mean and listens. "We have to go now!" you motion for him to follow you.
						Making an instantaneous decision he follows you along with Sarah. Madeline
						moves back through the hidden side door into the crew area. You follow her
						around passageways and down stairways until finally you come to an end in
						the pathway.</p>
					<p>Approaching a monolithic hatchway Madeline moves towards the large round
						release valves on the door. She motions for you and Bernard to turn the
						handles, which you both do accordingly, unleashing large creaking sounds
						from the metal contraption. You can only wonder why a door like this would
						exist here on the ship. Opening the large metal door you're surprised at how
						easily it moves on its hinges.</p>
					<p>You get the feeling that somehow this area of the ship has not been
						forgotten over the years, even though it exists far off the beaten path,
						deep down in the bowels of this giant beast.</p>
					<p>A rhythmically pulsating green and blue web radiates out of the door
						projecting onto the walls. As you move the door open it reminds you of
						moonlight reflecting off of waves during a bright night, except for the deep
						tones of green and teal which gives an aquarium feel of sorts.</p>
					<p>A large tank bound on its corners by metal borders with large rivets rests
						on the side wall of the room. Upon closer inspection you notice that the
						wall that the tank is fixed to is actually a hull wall of the ship. The
						hull's slight angle signaling that on the other side is the ocean rushing
						past.</p>
					<p>You see a ladder leading up to the top of the tank, a small metal hatchway
						rests on the top. Looking into the tank you're a little confused by what
						looks like an underwater vehicle.</p>
					<p>Quickly you assemble the pieces of the puzzle, the scuba equipment in the
						closet, the vehicle in the tank, the hull of the ship, the hatchway on the
						top of the tank and you can make out a second hatchway on what appears to be
						the hull of the ship from inside the tank.</p>
					<p>Bernard seems to make the connection as well. As he moves over to a
						makeshift closet filled with scuba equipment Madeline moves into the room
						and seems to will the door closed behind herself. It moves gently and makes
						no sound and you watch as the handles rotate around locking the door.</p>
					<p>"So this is how we get out of here." Bernard says looking toward Madeline.
						"We don our scuba equipment, make our way into the tank, and when all is
						just right we open the hatch, and ferry yourselfs safely away using that
						machine."</p>
					<p>"You are a quick learner Bernard. I see why you have been chosen for this
						mission." Madeline says.</p>
					<p>"Mission? I don't know what you're referring to. I don't recall signing up
						for this mission."</p>
					<p>"The reflections that you see in the time that you live are based on a
						smooth transition from cause to effect. From the perspective of those that
						see a different chain of events, a more connected chain, this is your
						purpose. The ways of your world are different than ours." Madeline says.</p>
					<p>She seems to want to move on from the conversation and her attention is
						drawn over to a storage box. She slowly opens the box and motions toward the
						contents inside.</p>
					<p>"In here you will find enough food for a week. You should stay here, make
						this your home for now. The other ghosts will have trouble locating you
						here. Not many people living or dead know of this place." She says then
						gracefully moves toward a small table with a lamp. Twisting the latch near
						the base of the lamp you start to smell a faint odor of kerosene. She lights
						the lamp and motions toward more supplies on the floor next to the table.
						"There's enough oil here to last you well over a week or so, and the doorway
						in the corner leads to a lavatory." Madeline says.</p>
					<p>Bernard seems concerned as are you and Sarah. He moves forward, "We may be
						down here for awhile then?" he says.</p>
					<p>"Awhile yes. But, nevertheless if you stay here there will be an opportunity
						for you to exit the ship, this I can see for certain." She says. And with
						that Madeline moves toward the heavy monolith of the doorway. She turns back
						around to say some final words, "I will be down here from time to time so
						don't worry. Does this suit your living requirements? " All three of you
						look around and think of all the luxuries this ship is know for that you
						will miss. As for satisfying the requirements for living, this will abide,
						but barely.</p>
					<p>Reading your expressions she starts, "Okay then I will see you when the time
						is right."</p>
					<p>Slowly she departs through the door.</p>
					<p>You watch as the faint green cloud surrounding her completely exits the
						room. It fills empty and isolated even with all three of you there. The lamp
						puts out a dim light not nearly enough for you to see the walls of the room,
						but once again it is sufficient.</p>
					<p>Time passes... and passes... and passes.</p>
					<p>You can feel you eyes start to loose focus in this dim light. How many days
						has it been? You guess two days, plus or minus of course. Two long days.</p>
					<p>Suddenly you hear something! A rumble shakes the ship violently. You can see
						the hull creaking from the stresses.</p>
					<p>The tank of water buckles slightly and you watch as leaks produce water
						spouts into the room. Wondering what to do you move over to try to stop the
						leaks, then another explosion ripples through the ship. This time the
						explosion seemed to come from the other side, the bow of the ship.</p>
					<p>You can feel the ship start to move in an unusual direction finally coming
						to a halt.</p>
					<p>A green glow moves through the hatch leading into the room. Madeline. She's
						moves quickly towards you three. "The time is now, you need to move quickly.
						The ship is going down. There is no time to waste." Pointing to the scuba
						diving gear in the closet she motions for you to get suited up. Fortunately
						all of you are familiar with diving and put the equipment on in a timely
						fashion.</p>
					<p>The ship starts to jerk and you can see the floor increasingly tilt.
						Madeline motions for you to climb up to the top of the tank and open the
						hatch which you do in an organized fashion. The water seems to be
						pressurized and goes no higher than the hatch level when opened.</p>
					<p>You move into the tank. Madeline follows by moving through the glass and
						metal and into the tank with you. She motions to a button on the vehicle
						which you switch on.</p>
					<p>The vehicle comes to life. Using simple hand signals she quickly shows you
						how to operate the vehicle. The directions are basic and universal. Getting
						the gist of what she's trying to say you quickly grab the controls.</p>
					<p>All three of you hold on tight to the vehicle. Madeline motions towards
						another switch on the wall of the tank. You press it and the hatchway
						leading out of the ship opens. Swirling currents wipe through the tank,
						attempting to suck all of you out into the swirling ocean. You find yourself
						holding onto the vehicle for dear life. The vehicle is pulled forward by the
						current and out into the ocean.</p>
					<p>You gingerly try the motor to help break free from the current, and it seems
						to help. You ratchet up the motor and move forward and out into the
						turbulent water swirling by the ship as it sinks.</p>
					<p>Making your way through the swirling current is quite difficult but
						fortunately the machine has good power to it. Finally after a couple of
						hundred yards the current subsides and the water becomes more still. You
						keep on moving forward away from the ship as it twists and turns behind you.</p>
					<p>When you feel that you are a safe distance from the sinking vessel you move
						up to the surface and see a land mass in the distance.</p>
					<p>You make it to the island and land there within the hour.</p>
					<p>Watching front the soft sands of the beach you're amazed by the sight as the
						ship is engulfed by water.</p>
					<p>Tens if not hundreds of lifeboats circle around the spot where the ship was
						once. You remove your scuba equipment and make your way over a dune to see a
						road filled with parked cars. The road is full of people observing the last
						dance of the Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
					<p>You, Sarah and Bernard all grab each other in a group hug. Sarah has tears
						on her face and kisses you. "You rescued me Travis." she says "I will always
						remember this." All three of you then make your way to the nearest airport
						and get the next flight back home finally parting ways on the last leg of
						the journey.</p>
					<p>You and Sarah stay in touch over the next month, but you both have heard
						nothing from Bernard. After a couple of months Bernard sends a short email.</p>
					<p>"Dear Travis and Sarah, I've decided to move into another period of my life
						and retire. I've seen too many things in my many years of travels, and I
						feel that this is a good place to draw a line in the sand and jump over to a
						new life. I enjoyed the investigative work, and value our time together. If
						you ever make your way up to Montana definitely drop by. -Bernard"</p>
					<p>The life altering journey you and Sarah had together seems to be strong. She
						mentions something about taking a trip together. "This time for fun, not for
						work." The thought of spending time with Sarah is music to your ears.</p>
					<p>The End.</p>

					<p>While looking around the room you notice someone. It takes a second to place
						the face, but it is so distinctive that the memory jumps back into your
						head. The face is that of Rudolphe Thornsden, a painter who's works are
						being exhibited and sold on the boat. He was at the auction the afternoon
						prior to Sarah's disappearance. Rudolphe appears to be sitting by himself.
						You wonder if you should go and introduce yourself.</p>

					<p>You sit for a couple of minutes looking at the intricate designs around the
						bar. There are hundreds of small boxes with glass faces (all the same size)
						lining the walls . Inside the boxes are pinned butterfly's. Each box has
						exactly one butterfly. The variety is amazing.</p>
					<p>Modern instrumental music makes the place flow smoothly. Everyone seems to
						enjoy their conversations by the dim recessed lighting, and ornamental
						lamps.</p>
					<p>The jukebox in the corner is as unique as the bar. Inlaid wood creates sharp
						patterns up the front of the box. A CD changes just as you look over. The
						mechanical assembly is different than the standard platter changers, somehow
						a little more daring.</p>
					<p>Small tubes filled with liquid are lit with various colors, arching across
						the top half of the jukebox.</p>

					<p>As you're walking down the hallway to your room you notice something out of
						the corner of your eye. You're surprised by the odd motion and turn to look.
						You're brain spends several seconds trying to make scenes of it. Finally you
						realize that you're looking at a ghost, but somehow it seems not to notice
						you 30 meters away. It floats down a corridor only to be followed by someone
						that looks more of this world. Your room attendant David!</p>
					<p>You gather your wits and slowly sneak up to the corridor. You peek your head
						to look down the corridor and see nothing so you start walking down the
						corridor looking for clues as to where they may have gone. The corridor ends
						abruptly with the hull of the ship. You've lost the trail.</p>
					<p>"Was that really David I saw?" Your mind says "Yes!" but you're hesitant to
						put much weight on the matter. The days on this ship have been long and
						stressful, but still. "That was David" your mind mentions one last time
						before you wrap up the incident with no evidence of any sort.</p>

					<p>Time is running out as you notice the massive ship start to move closer and
						closer to landfall. You make your way to Bernard's cabin and grab a drink
						from the bar. "Bernard, our time here is coming to an end." you say
						hesitantly. Bernard nods back in open disappointment. The search for Sarah
						seems hopeless at this moment as you only have a couple of pieces of
						information to go on after departing from the ship.</p>
					<p>It takes another 30 minutes before the QE2 arrives at the port of Gullok and
						another 30 minutes to finally dock at the port. The hallways are a flurry
						with passengers getting their belongings in order for the departure.</p>
					<p>You hear the Captain's voice over the intercom "Passengers, we are now
						docked at Gullok and you are free to depart the ship at any time within the
						next 3 hours. Be advised to respect the local customs which include
						restrictions on alcohol consumption and clothing restrictions. Once again it
						has been my pleasure to serve you during this journey up the eastern
						Mediterranean coastline. We very much look forward to providing you
						traveling services in the future." In other words, a short dry speech which
						everyone seems to ignore.</p>
					<p>You return to your cabin and start gathering your things together. Still you
						hope for one final sign, anything that would point you in the direction of
						Sarah, alas nothing takes hold.</p>
					<p>A knock on the door. You open it to see a mass of 7 or so local officers
						stacked outside your cabin.</p>
					<p>A man makes his way through the crowd and says in broken English "Mr. Neff,
						you are?" You reply accordingly. He then continues "May we come in?" without
						really waiting for a reply several of the officers enter your cabin. "Sit
						down please Mr. Neff." the man says. "We have some questions for you. You
						wife, she is missing right?"</p>
					<p>They proceed to question you about the incident, eventually taking you down
						to the local police station for questioning. A representative from the
						cruise line is present as well. A missing person report is filed. Several
						documents are signed by the cruise line representative.</p>
					<p>Lieutenant Farse arrives at the station and speaks with the local detective
						for quite awhile. The door to the conference room is closed, but you catch
						every third or fourth word through the thin walls. You here Detective Farse
						explaining the situation (although with significant sections missing). He
						appears to corroborate your story, but a bit begrudgingly.</p>
					<p>When all of the documents are wrapped up and the two detectives finish there
						conversation and exit the conference room, the detective announces, "Mr.
						Neff, you are free to go."</p>
					<p>A thud in your chest takes your breath away for a second as you realize that
						this is how it is done. This is how someone is declared missing, and never
						seen again. A litigious process frosted with signatures.</p>
					<p>Officers drive you back to the hulking mass of steel that you just left. The
						setting sun paints a dark shadow running down the ship as it prepares for
						nighttime. Thousands of inset lights start to appear running the length of
						the ship as the sun quickly sets.</p>
					<p>A thought runs through your mind, "Yet another unsolved mystery slightly
						tarnished her perfection" you think of the ship. All of the other passengers
						have left and you are escorted to your room to gather your things.</p>
					<p>As you leave the ship it gives no clue as to the supernatural phenomenon
						that are housed aboard. Being the last passenger off you feel somehow
						honored by the secrets bestowed to you on this journey yet tormented by the
						loss of a very close friend. You wrestle with the question "Was Sarah a
						friend" and the answer strikes back. She was more than a friend, she was a
						love.</p>
					<p>Daydreams of a future together dance through your head gently taunting the
						loss of what could have been.</p>
					<p>You find a hotel close by and give Bernard a call. He, as well, has found a
						place close by and you decide to team up to try and find Sarah. A week goes
						by and you've exhausted the few leads that you had.</p>
					<p>The search feels hopeless and your finances are starting to dry up so you
						decide to call off the search and head back home.</p>
					<p>Several years go by. You've spent quite a bit of your free-time over the
						years trying to hunt down clues to Sarah's disappearance. You've amassed
						many pieces of personal information, but still have found nothing to lead
						you to believe that she is alive.</p>
					<p>"Is she really dead?" you wonder. "Maybe they really did throw her
						overboard." Somehow it doesn't make sense that they would do that, but still
						you've heard nothing so you can't help but wonder.</p>
					<p>You've found no one who can replace her gentle smile and soft voice. Her
						caring attitude and funny sayings.</p>
					<p>On a snowy winter day several years later you hurry out to get the mail from
						the mailbox. Bringing it in you throw it on the table and are surprised by a
						soft thud it makes. You cycle through the mail looking for the culprit and
						find a letter with no return address on it and something somewhat heavy
						inside. You open the letter and pull out a ring. holding it up to the light
						you realize that it is a wedding ring.</p>
					<p>Rushing to the dresser in your bedroom you pull out another ring, a matching
						ring. Inside the ring is an inscription that appears to make no sense at
						first but soon you realize that it is a message encoded using the shorthand
						encryption you used back when you were a private investigator.</p>
					<p>"Is this some sort of trap?" you wonder. But why would it be after all this
						time.</p>
					<p>Many hours of daydreams that you've had over the last several years seem to
						instantly come back into focus. Things are looking up. Things are looking
						very up in fact. The search is not over by a long shot...</p>
					<p>The End.</p>

					<p>You head back to your cabin to relax and think a bit about the days events.

					<p>The spring loaded door automatically shuts behind you.</p>
					<p>Struggling in the dark, you feel hand cuffs clamp around your hands. Then a

						then the sounds of wheels turning; a cart of some sort is wheeled into the

						needle in your shoulder. Shortly after you fall unconscious as they wheel
						you out of the room.</p>
					<p>Your eyes open and you find yourself in a large room with a long dining
						table. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows you can see a spectacular view
						looking out over the entire the ship. The light in the room is low and
						candles line the table. The chairs are ornate with gold painted trim. There
						is a man in front of the door leading out of the room. He opens the door and
						a well dressed man in his late 50's enters the room and moves toward you.</p>
					<p>"I don't think we've met before, I'm Jonas." he pauses for a moment. "It
						seems that you've been busy during your stay." He then drops a stack of
						papers onto the table. Focusing on the pile, you realize that these are the
						papers that you found in the safe. The men who apprehended you must have
						grabbed them while in your cabin. They must have known what they were
						looking for ahead of time given that you hid the papers.</p>
					<p>Jonas says, "These documents were suppose to be buried long ago." He moves
						around you, circling, then takes a sharp look at your wrists to make sure
						the cuffs are still present. "These papers implicate my father and his
						corporation in some rather nasty business dealings. Therefore, they now
						implicate me as well.</p>
					<p>He slowly moves toward the wall of windows to gather a better view of the
						ship. "I want to tell you a bit about my father. My father was not what
						anyone would argue to be a nice person here to help those in need. He saw
						the world more as a genetic soup of those who thrive, and those who slave
						away for survival. He would be highly displeased by your meddling."</p>
					<p>He continues, "It's a shame that I've had to do this before. Although, the
						other investigator never made it to anything that worried me. These papers
						however, they worry me. If anything it is a sign that you are working with
						others. Tell me Travis, who exactly HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING WITH?" he moves
						very close to your face.</p>
					<p>"Oh, how did I find out about the documents? Let me give you some insight
						into a small flaw in your reasoning. Maybe you forgot, or maybe you just
						didn't care, but the one most important thing that you failed to take into
						consideration is. THEY ARE DEAD! These ghosts are not accountable to you,
						me, or anyone here. They operate off of shear instinct."</p>
					<p>"Your estimation of their solidarity is vastly overrated. There are many
						members in their ranks who felt differently than the few you probably met.
						Tell me, exactly how many ghosts did you chat with? My guess is just a
						handful." He pauses to give you time to respond. You choose to sit quietly.
						"What, did you not even meet A HANDFUL! You know nothing! The specters have
						set you up for a suicide mission that you performed only partially, opening
						yourself up to immense danger. You decided to hold onto something that you
						considered to be just paper, foolish little man. THIS COULD HAVE DESTROYED
						ME!" he fumes.</p>
					<p>"You are out of your league young traveler, and will return to this ship in
						another form very soon. As a ghost!" Shivers start to tremor down your back.
						"Oh, I seem to have caught your attention there. You seem to think of life
						as finite and have little concern given you displesure for it. But I assure
						you that there is life, although different, on the other side of living."</p>
					<p>Jonas motions to the doorway where Mark is standing in the shadows. "Now you
						will learn from your misunderstanding. When you venture into the world of
						spirit you will meet two factions, one side is ruled by Madeline the Ghost
						Queen. The other is ruled by someone a little less soft around the edges..."
						Mark begins to move you toward the doorway out of the room as you hear over
						your shoulder the final words "My father, you naive boy."</p>
					<p>Shortly thereafter you are taken into the private elevator to a dark room at
						the bottom of the ship. You can see the bilge water waving in harmony to the
						vibrations from the crushing force of the vessel as it moves through the
						ocean. A lone light shows the way to a small shack fortified by heavy
						rounded beams along its exterior with a water tight door which is open. Mark
						places you in the room and you do not resist. Thoughts of Sarah flow through
						your mind and are eclipsed by thoughts of the fun and carefree life of your
						youth. Visions of your family and the feeling of being a cared for
						individual. Bright memories to balance out the dreary and desperate present.
						Mark closes the door behind you. You hear it lock into place and soon water
						starts to rush into the chamber.</p>
					<p>The thought of a verifiable life after death comforts you in some way, but
						not as it had before. You pass from this world and awake in a new dimension
						with a whole new world of understanding ahead of you. The oddness of this
						new place reminds you of being a very young child. A figure emerges from the
						fog holding out her hand. She takes your hand and gently moves you down a
						path into an equally foggy abyss.</p>
					<p>The End.</p>

				<content>
					<p>Feeling hunger pains wrenching your stomach you decide to head for the
						closest café. Looking at a map you find your location and start to make your
						way to the top deck.</p>
					<p>As you're making your way up to the "Top of the Mountain Café" you hear a
						strange sound, a whooshing sound (like a flock of birds somehow moving in
						unison). You watch as the helicopter approaches the ship. Circling around
						just once then landing on a helipad off to the other side of the ship.</p>
					<p>You grab a coffee at the café and notice the sign that says "Open twenty
						four hours". Sitting and thinking about the days events you can't help but
						reflect on how frustrating it is having very few clues at hand.</p>
					<p>You hear the sound again as the helicopter lifts off of the ship then back
						the way it came. You've never seen a helicopter landing on a cruise ship
						before, you guess that it is a pretty rare occurrence. Your mind wonders if
						someone is injured or sick and has to be taken into shore. It didn't look
						like an emergency vehicle though you reflect.</p>
					<p>Drinking your coffee you refocus on your tasks. Finally getting your energy
						back, and your thoughts in line, you decide to head back to your cabin.</p>
					<p>Suddenly you hear a jerking sound, a creaking sound of something violent.
						Then you hear a concussion wave of sound and the ship seems to jerk to the
						side noticeably. A couple of seconds later the creaking has not stopped.
						"What in the hell is happening," you wonder to yourself.</p>
					<p>Sirens start to go off down the hallways of the ship. Flashing red lights
						accompanied them and the hallway lights dim as if converting from one form
						of power to a back up system. The intercoms in the hallways and the rooms
						start blare with the sound of a crew member over the intercom. "This is not
						a drill, please gather your belongings and proceed to your designated
						evacuation location. This is the location which you were instructed to
						return to in case the ship was to be evacuated."</p>
					<p>Shortly after hearing this message you hear another explosion. The ship
						starts to move to the side in strange ways and the creaking of the ship's
						hull sounds like a car going through a never ending accident. You see a crew
						member running down the hall opening doors with his keys. He seems to be
						searching for anybody and everybody he can find making sure everyone knows
						that this is not a drill. Seeing you he rushes towards you, and grabs you by
						the shoulder. "This is serious you need to get your things right now and get
						down to your evacuation spot! I do not have time to explain this twice! Good
						luck." With that he takes off looking for more people down the hallway.</p>
					<p>The boat starts tipping to one side and appears to have completely stopped.
						You find it odd that the hallway looks so much different when slightly out
						of balance. You grab your important items from the room. Then you move
						through the hallway as quickly as you can without falling over from the
						increasing angle of the floor.</p>
					<p>You make your way down to the designated evacuation location and see people
						in lines scurrying up and down the deck looking for people that they know.
						You feel everyone breathing anxiously wondering what the future holds for
						them. People are frantic. People seem to be having trouble standing upright
						with the ship tilting significantly. You see crew members lining people up
						for the lifeboats. "Women and children over here, this line is just for
						women and children!". A man tries to force his way through the line and is
						quickly knocked to the ground by the crew members. There's no time for
						formalities, you realize the crew is very serious.</p>
					<p>On the breeze you can hear a band playing. Looking around you realize that
						far down the deck there is a five piece band trying to calm the passengers
						as they enter the lifeboats. "Sarah, will I see you again?" you wonder as a
						tear pops to your eye.</p>
					<p>With that you enter the lifeboat. As the boat lowers to the water you
						realize how significantly the boat has twisted. The lifeboat is very close
						to the hull as it descend. Men in the boat are pushing it off of the hull so
						that the boat may clear the water. Finally the boat lowers to the water, the
						engine starts and you realize the turbulence of the water is causing the
						boat to move into the hull. Men are having to force the boat away from the
						hull with their hands. Finally the boat makes headway away from the hull of
						the ship, the engine pushes the boat out into the ocean water.</p>
					<p>Looking back you see the QE2 precariously tipping on the verge. The crew
						members on board are truly heroic in there actions to save people on the
						ship.</p>
					<p>As the crashing sound of the ship dissipates in the background you can hear
						voices of the people on the boat murmuring. One voice in particular catches
						your attention. A deep rustic voice, conflicted and yet reasonably intact.
						"Now..." the voice says "Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."
						You look over to the figure silhouetted by the light of the boat in the
						corner as he slowly turns his head. It is Mark!</p>
					<p>"I am become death" rolls through your mind like a torrent. Truly this is
						the destruction of a world in which those past death were brought back to
						live once again. How fitting you think to yourself...</p>
					<p>More than ever you can't help but feel that Mark had something to do with
						this, and although you can't prove anything he becomes a very very dark
						figure in your mind. Trying to take your mind off of what he just said you
						look back to the ship. You can see the full view of the deck that overlooks
						you at a strange angle. You see a person standing up looking out over the
						balcony and you make out the figure of a ghost standing beside him.</p>
					<p>Using all of your might to stay steady in these turbulent waters, you
						realize it's David. The ghostly figure next to him, "Who can that be?" you
						wonder. The ghost seems to be an older person with very similar features
						holding his arm around David's shoulder. You recall David saying this his
						father worked on the QE2 a long time ago. You get the feeling that this is
						his father welcoming him into a new life that awaits in the spirit world.
						Yes David will not be leaving that ship this time. There is no time left for
						him or many of the heroic crew members.</p>
					<p>Over the course of the next hour you watch as the ship sinks into the water.
						You see tens if not hundreds of other small boats make their way to an
						island several miles to the north. Landing on the coast you see a makeshift
						camp set up by many of the crew members and many locals as well. Emergency
						workers making sure that everyone is taken care of. People searching for
						loved ones. You see people crying alone. You hear names yelling out into the
						sky which go unanswered.</p>
					<p>You recognize a face as you move through the camp. Bernard! He sees you as
						well. You team up and look for Sarah, but after several hours you realize
						that she didn't make it off the ship, or at least she didn't make it here.
						Given that this is the only island in the vicinity, the situation is looking
						even more bleak.</p>
					<p>Night arrives and stories come out around the campfires. Someone mentions
						where you are, the isle of Crete. Stories circulate that the captain (Anton)
						is missing, no one has seen him since. Several other crew members are
						missing as well. How tragic and how unfortunate to be a crew member on this
						ship today.</p>
					<p>The next morning you and Bernard make your way to the local airport and book
						the next flight home. Finally parting ways during a connection flight on
						last leg of your journey, you wish each other the best of luck and promise
						to keep in touch. When you get home you start your search to try and find
						anybody who might have found a woman named Sarah from the sinking of the
						Queen Elizabeth II. You find nothing that indicates that she made it off the
						ship.</p>
					<p>Roughly one month later you receive an e-mail from Bernard. In it he talks
						about how he's made the decision to move onto another period of his life,
						that of being retired. He said he appreciates the time he spend with you and
						Sarah, but the toll on his mind and his body is too great for him to
						continue at this point in his life. With that he's decided to spend the rest
						of his life moving down another path, another journey, a more predicable
						future.</p>
					<p>You feel for Bernard's words as they represent your words as well. Words
						that you cannot speak for yourself but your desire to continue as a private
						investigator is no more. Months go by, and you decide to take a job in a
						warehouse loading containers with packaged goods. Although the work is hard
						you feel good knowing that the packages you pack will be used by somebody to
						make their lives better. Every time you try to get back into private
						investigation it seems like a lost cause as memories of Sarah flood back
						through your head, along with memories of your near-death experience aboard
						the Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
					<p>Years go by and you continue scouring the Internet looking for any clues
						that might signal that Sarah is alive.</p>
					<p>One day you open up your mail box and there is a single letter. The address
						is handwritten with a partial return P.O. Box. Just enough information for
						the message to make it back. Something is loose inside of the package and
						moves around as you open the letter. Prying open the envelope you see a
						shiny object. Pulling it out you realize it's a ring.</p>
					<p>Thoughts come flowing back in your mind. Quickly you realize that that you
						recognize the ring. You take it into your office. Pulling a drawer open you
						pull out another ring, the ring you and Sarah purchased as phony wedding
						rings years before the QE2 assignment. They match perfectly. This was most
						definitely Sarah's ring.</p>
					<p>Nothing remains in the envelop. The only hint you have is that the letter
						came from a small city in Ohio. Pulling out your fingerprint dusting kit you
						dust the envelop. Hundreds of prints pop out immediately, most illegible. It
						will take you many hours to attempt to match the prints with the prints you
						have on file for Sarah.</p>
					<p>Suddenly an idea pops into your head. "What about the inside of the
						envelope?". You pull out a set of scissors and carefully cut the envelope
						along it's edges. Opening the envelope up and laying it flat you dust what
						was the inside for fingerprints. A single print pops out as clear as day, in
						magnificent detail. A thumb print. The thumb was rolled from side to side
						giving a complete full outline. As complete as you'd on an id card (albeit a
						little smugged but not badly). "She's alive!" you exclaim under your breath.</p>
					<p>"Time for a vacation" you think to yourself, "Starting right now". You start
						to gather your things.</p>
					<p>The End.</p>

					<p>Your mind feels weighed down by all of the emotions of the day. You recall
						seeing a nice quaint little lounge over by your cabin, so you head over
						there for a bit and take a seat in a plush and elegant reclining chair.</p>
					<p>Looking over to your right you stare out of a pair of picture windows and
						watch as the ship makes its way through the waters. As you sit you notice a
						large painting hanging on a near wall. Looking a little closer you realize
						that the painting appears to be about 10 feet diagonal, and seems to
						represent some sort of significant transaction much like the signing of the
						bill of rights or some such legal matter.</p>
					<p>After a couple of minutes of attempting to gather as much information as you
						can about the painting without actually having to get up you decide to put
						some weight back on your feet and walk over to take a closer look. It
						strikes you as somewhat odd that a painting where people are signing
						paperwork would be represented with so much emotion.</p>
					<p>The dark tones of the art piece remind you of the dreamlike characteristics
						of the Chiaroscuro painting style perfected so long ago by Da Vinci. Looking
						down to the brass plaque next to the painting you read the inscription,
						"Signing for the Queen Elizabeth II" an equally vague description of the
						events. You wonder why this painting is even here. It doesn't fit in with
						much of the other artwork on the ship.</p>
					<p>The characters in the painting are so dramatic, much like the characters in
						The Last Super. You wonder who these characters are.</p>
					<p>Just then out of the corner of your eye you notice a man approaching you. As
						you look over he comes into focus and you can see that it is your room
						attendant David.</p>
					<p>"So you seem interested in this painting, can I ask why?" David questions.
						You reply, "The characters, the personalities they seem so subtlety
						extravagant. Why is this picture even here?"</p>
					<p>"I wish I had the answer because I've been looking at this painting for the
						last 12 years. I can tell you some of the characters in the painting but not
						much else. The library upstairs has a small section devoted to the history
						of the ship. I bet you would be able to find more information there about
						this painting."</p>
					<p>"Well then," you ask, "who are these characters, especially who is this
						man?" You point to a businessman sitting at the table signing the papers
						that seem to be the focus of the scene. "That is Jonas Venport senior. His
						holdings in the Cunard Corporation were significant. He would be the logical
						person to sign the paperwork that eventually led to the creation of this
						vessel." he says.</p>
					<p>He continues, "The boy next to him is his son Jonas Venport Junior. His
						family still maintains significant control over this vessel. It's odd to
						think that one family has had such an iron grip over this ship for the last
						70 years, but such is the case."</p>
					<p>"And what about the gentleman on the other side of the table? It almost
						seems that there are two groups represented here." you ask.</p>
					<p>David says "You are correct. This painting, as far as I can tell, represents
						a triad of interests; the business side which the Venport's have an iron
						grip on, the builders which are a conglomeration of hundreds of companies
						who worked together to make this ship a reality."</p>
					<p>David continues, "The members seated off to the back corner of the table, I
						feel that they represent the government. The government needed a craft such
						as the QE2. The QE1 was quickly becoming antiquated with the end of World
						War I. They needed a new ship that would be able to act with a dual-purpose.
						One in times of piece, and the other in times of war. It is no coincidence
						that this ship was over-designed for its purpose from its inception. Deals
						were worked with the government to make the ship as rugged as possible."</p>
					<p>You look more closely at the painting and notice a man sitting in the
						background. The look on his face is strange. An ancient look almost of
						something that seems to dwarf the meaning of this entire scene. He seems to
						represent time very very long ago at the nexus of changes that became modern
						humanity. It's amazing that a face can invoke such a emotion. "Who is that
						man back in the corner." You point your finger. David replies, "Yes I
						noticed him as well. His clothing seems out of place doesn't it. And, the
						look of his face seems so unusual. Unfortunately I know nothing about him."</p>
					<p>"The library upstairs," David says, "That is probably your best bet. Even
						over the Internet you probably won't find much information on this painting.
						It's not really recognized outside of this ship." Looking at the man's face
						again you feel an insistent tug on your shoulder telling you that you should
						go and find out more about this painting.</p>
					<p>"Thank you David I will let you know what I find the next time I see you."
						And with that David nods his head and you both part ways. You head up to the
						library.</p>
					<p>While entering the first thing you notice is the high quality and well
						stained wood trim seeming to hold up the ceiling and matching the bookcases.
						The stain is a deep cherry color and uniform throughout the room. You get
						the feeling that a master craftsmen was set to work and told spare no
						expense.</p>
					<p>Walking slowly you take inventory of the sections. It's not a big library by
						any stretch, but the space is used carefully making you feel that it is a
						much more influential place than the size would signify.</p>
					<p>You walk to the back corner of the library hoping to find a librarian or
						someone else, but no one is to be found. The books seem to be on the honor
						system you gather. Then, you see the section that David was referring to.
						"RMS Queen Elizabeth II ".</p>
					<p>Making your way into the section you're surprised at how much information
						you see. There must easily be 200 books. Some appear to be large picture
						books, others appear to be history books bound in makeshift bindings. There
						are several books filled with real photographs, glued into place, by
						companies that were involved in different parts of the building of the ship.
						Even detailed ship schematics seem to be available.</p>
					<p>You pull a random book from the shelf, "Architecture of the QE2". The book
						seems to be a good place to start so you take it back to a long well-crafted
						table in the center of the room. Sitting down you start flipping through the
						pages hoping to catch a glimpse of the painting that you're looking for.
						Realizing that this might be a somewhat futile endeavor you make a deal with
						yourself to spend no more than an hour on this project.</p>
					<p>Many notable pictures that you recognize are well-documented in the book,
						but you notice no reference to the painting in the lobby.</p>
					<p>A chill comes over you. It is very quick to set on. You feel a cold breeze,
						and you realize that there are no windows (which sends a dull shiver up your
						spine).</p>
					<p>Making it all the more odd your mind puts together another interesting
						revelation, the door leading into this library is closed. "Why am I so cold
						all of a sudden," you ask yourself looking up to the ceiling thinking maybe
						the air-conditioners kicked on for some reason. Maybe a broken thermostat or
						some such.</p>
					<p>The breeze picks up and chills doubly as you realize that it seems to be
						coming from right next to you. You look over to see small particles of dust
						circling just 5 feet off to your right. The circling seems to pick up and
						moves over the table and back to the section representing the history of the
						ship.</p>
					<p>It picks up speed again and now you see loose pieces of paper flying in this
						mini cyclone. Covers on the books start to rattle. Your eyes watch the
						spectacle hypnotized.</p>
					<p>The storm picks up the intensity yet again and books start to move around
						yet none of them seem to actually make it off the shelf. Then suddenly one
						book gives way and flies up into the cyclone. It juggles around for a moment
						and flies out of the cyclone falling down onto the table.</p>
					<p>Slowly it slides towards you. Lights flicker in the room as the lamps
						overhead swing back and forth on their wires. The book comes into clear view
						right in front of you. The pages start turning erratically from the waves of
						pulsing air in the room.</p>
					<p>Then, as suddenly as it started, the winds come to a halt and the cyclone
						disappears. The noisy clacking of the room stops and you find the book open
						in front of you.</p>
					<p>You look down to the book and recognize a picture of the painting from the
						downstairs lobby. You want to jump out of your seat and get as far away from
						this book as you can, but you're unable to move. You feel a weight on your
						shoulders as if someone is forcing you to stay seated.</p>
					<p>Lines start to materialize in deep and gory red on the book page,
						accompanied by the sharp noise of a surface scratching. Just as if an
						invisible hand were painting in blood on the book you read "Jonas will find
						you soon! Give us the documents!"</p>
					<p>After a moment the pressure on your shoulders seems to subside and you take
						this as meaning that you are free to go. With that you quickly push the
						chair from below you and make your way to the entrance of the library
						looking behind only a single time to make sure that nothing, absolutely
						nothing is following you out the door.</p>
					<p>Terror builds in your heart as you realize that someone or something
						understands your every motive. Up until now you felt unsure as to the ghosts
						powers to persuade the world of the living. Now, now you realize that you
						should in fact fear the ghost. They very much can and will cross over the
						physical barriers to your world as they wish.</p>

					<p>As you walk down the hallway you hear a voice of a young woman calmly saying
						"Danger... You're in Danger." The sound echoes down the corridor followed by
						another passage "The documents... Give them to David before a judgment is
						made."</p>
					<p>You stop moving. The voice goes silent followed by nothing but the gentle
						buzz of the ship as it slightly sways from side to side. The hallway
						lighting gently flickers momentarily. You wait for a minute then continue.</p>

					<p>Moving out to the starboard deck, you see a glare coming from a high vantage
						point. You move closer, but can't make sense of the structure. What you can
						make out is that it is glass. Past the glass you can see many plants. Some
						vines seem to be working their way around the inside of the enclosure,
						covered by leafs the size of LP records.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately you can't move any closer, as the structure is very high up on
						the ship and there is no pathway along this level. Even with time of the
						essence, your curiosity must be appeased and you move back indoors toward a
						map of the ship. A brass-etched map of the ship with low profile lights
						along its borders hangs on the wall close to the staircase. The engraving
						has a darkly colored edge to it with delicate shading that makes the letters
						and the diagrams stand out from the background. As small a detail as a map
						is, thousands of people have probably used it over the years to help find
						their ways around the winding maze of lobbies, bars, shopping centers, and
						corridors to the common areas. A craftsman etched this map, yet another
						testament to the glory of the RMS Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
					<p>As your finger follows the various decks to try and deduce where the glass
						room is, you realize that it can only be the Growing Room. "A greenhouse,"
						you think to yourself. After all, it does make sense to have a greenhouse on
						a ship. Prior to refrigeration it was probably an essential piece of
						culinary life aboard the ship. Traveling to various ports around the world
						would make it difficult to plan meals, especially common western vegetables
						such as leaf lettuces that are hard to find in many parts of the world.</p>
					<p>You plan your path and make your way to the elevators. It looks like you'll
						have to take not one, but two elevators to get there. The main lobby
						elevator will take you to the top decks, the the second elevator will take
						you up toward the bridge area. You make your way with a bit of joy in your
						heart, as if finding a new treasure. Given the difficulty of the last
						several days, this is a welcome diversion.</p>
					<p>You arrive at your destination atop the bridge area of the ship in front of
						the greenhouse. There is a sign on the door. It appears that with the modern
						miracle of refrigeration, and advancements in the quality of food from
						around the world, the Growing Room is no longer essential to the daily diet
						of the passengers on the ship. Instead of tearing it down it's been turned
						into an attraction with bench seating looking out over the expansive view of
						the ship and 180 degree vista of the ocean. The gentle rocking of the ship
						is hardly noticeable but seems to make the time a bit more special as you
						sit enjoying the marvels that mankind can perform when people organize to
						work for a common cause.</p>
					<p>You hear a gentle wind blow through the green house, and something about it
						strikes you as odd. Looking around you realize that no windows are open,
						otherwise it would be fairly chilly in here. "Where is the wind coming
						from?" you wonder as you look back to the door. The large oxidized copper
						door has that very familiar green rusty look that you recall seeing on the
						roofs in Ottawa when you visited last. The large door seems to want to move,
						and rocks back and forth gently, but still not moving. Finally, it rocks and
						gathers enough steam to move slowly closed. The creaking sound of the hinges
						seems very loud in this quite place. The door closes fully and you hear the
						latches on the door set in the corresponding slots on the lock.</p>
					<p>Slowly the realization that something is unusual here dawns on you, and you
						watch as the wind quietly blows through the leaves on the plants, making the
						larger leaves rock back and forth. You stare as the wind seems to pinpoint
						itself on an adjacent bench across from you. Figures start to materialize,
						two figures whom you recognize. Madeline, petite with her feet dangling but
						still seated very proper to the left, and the gentlemen you met while
						unlocking the safe seated to the right, directly across from you. The
						gentleman has a much less tolerant look on his face as he takes shape.</p>
					<p>"Hello", you nod to the specters. They return the formality minus the
						greeting. Madeline starts off saying "How have you been Travis?" very
						formally and very indifferently. "I've been fine Madeline, what brings you
						both here?" you reply.</p>
					<p>Madeline replies, "Mr. Rothschild and I are brought here by the issue of the
						documents that we so desire. You have not presented them to David yet?" she
						half asks.</p>
					<p>"Oh yes the documents. I've been a bit busy and haven't had the opportunity
						to hand those off yet."</p>
					<p>Madeline stays silent. Mr Rothschild gets a bit fidgety and says "I think we
						have a bit of a misunderstanding about the importance of those documents.
						Basically they determine what happens with not only myself and Madeline, but
						hundreds of other spirits like ourselves. You see, we died and were brought
						here. We didn't have a choice in the matter. We were sent back here for a
						reason. No one told us the reason, but we were able to deduce that the world
						was not entirely happy with our deeds in the world of the living, and has
						abandoned us here on this ship. This is purely speculation of course as no
						authority figure has specifically told us anything concrete about how to get
						out of here and onto our rightful post-life destinations. We spirits here on
						the ship believe that those documents will rectify our past misgivings, if
						you will."</p>
					<p>There is a silence between you that lasts quite awhile as each of you seems
						to be waiting for the next move. Tensions start to rise. Mr Rothschild seems
						to be getting impatient. "Mr. Neff, would you please find the time to give
						those documents to David?"</p>
					<p>todo - Decision to reply back to this. You get a little touchy with one
						another. If you don't reply with a yes then the ghosts show you their powers
						to affect the world of the living. You leave on a sour note.</p>

				<content>
					<p>As you enter the hallway leading to your Cabin you hear a voice in the
						distance which seems to echo around the corridor on it's way down the
						hallways. "Hello, anyone there? I need some help." the voice asks but seems
						far off in the distance. Surely the plush carpeting and thick wallpapers
						would absorb the sounds in the hallway you think to yourself. But still, you
						hear the voice of an older gentlemen in search of assistance so you move
						toward it.</p>
					<p>Your search takes you around a corner and down a flight of stairs to an area
						with tall ceilings and well and evenly spaced double doors .</p>
					<p>"I seem to have lost my glasses," you hear the voice say, this time far
						closer than before. Still to your dismay you have to walk down a length
						hallway and round a corner. "The acoustics of this ship are bizarre," you
						openly mutter to yourself. You and this the mystery voice seem to be the
						only people present on this deck at this time.</p>
					<p>As you look around you realize that this area is used for meetings of large
						groups, a conference area of some sort. Rounding the corner you finally see
						where this noise is coming from. A tall elderly man dressed in formal attire
						with an air of civility to his demeanor is looking down at the ground. He
						notices you approaching and straightens up. "Hi there, thank god you showed
						up. I can't seem to find my glasses anywhere and I'm sure I must have
						dropped them somewhere around here." You quickly scan the area but don't see
						the glasses on first glance. The gentleman's suit looks like something your
						father would have worn when he was younger, a style quite unusual for an
						individual such as this. You get a strong feeling that this man is wealthy
						and has been wealthy for his entire life. He sports a vintage Rolex watch as
						if it were just another timepiece hidden underneath his shirt cuff.</p>
					<p>"Oh I do believe that I may have lost them, I'm not much good without them
						though. My eyesight left me quite awhile ago." You notice that his advanced
						age shows at the particular moment. His outline looks gaunt and rigid, you
						see little muscle tone at all except for around his mouth and his cheeks.
						"Were you walking out of that room when you realized that you lost them?"
						you ask. "Yes, exactly although it's odd that I would have taken them off at
						all." he replies.</p>
					<p>You move your search to the small outcroppings along the hallway that
						support marble semicircular platforms with vases with cut flowers. Then you
						see the glasses in question. They look like relics of a bygone era with
						smoothly polished glass lenses of less than perfect proportions. The bottom
						second of the lenses had a heavy bifocal lens part to them. Once again the
						situation seems rather odd, why would a man such as this be wearing heavy
						glasses that might have been advanced technology in your grandfathers era.
						Nevertheless you tell the man that you found the glasses and hand them to
						him. "Oh good, thank you kind sir for the assistance," he replies. "Can you
						do me one last service before you leave, I am in rare form tonight and seem
						to have forgot to get my briefcase in the conference room. Can you go in
						there and retrieve it? The room is dark now and I'm afraid it will be much
						more difficult for me to find it than you. It's right out in the open"</p>
					<p>The smile on his face is very personable as if this man although being an
						aristocrat still respects the peasants such as yourself aboard this ship.
						Nothing is offensive in his voice, in fact he is trying to be pleasant, but
						the truth of the matter is that he has not seen hardship and it exudes from
						his pours like a subtle truth in the air.</p>
					<p>You start to talk and turn you head in the direction of the doorway. "I'll
						go in and turn the lights on for you but you should grab your..." you feel a
						cold breeze and turn back to the gentleman standing only an arm's length
						away from you.</p>
					<p>He is gone...</p>
					<p>You look down the hallway and see nothing. Goose bumps run down your back as
						you come to the very clear realization that either two things happened here:
						your certifiably insane, or this figure was a shadow brought back only
						briefly. You look down and notice the clear depressions of footprints in the
						plush carpeting. The foot marks are not your style and not your size.</p>
					<p>The door is unlocked. Do you dare enter?</p>

				<content>
					<p>Walking down the hallway you see a courtesy phone booth off to the right.
						Remembering that you haven't checked your cabin voice mail in a while, you
						decide to take this opportunity and stroll over to the booth, closing the
						door behind you.</p>
					<p>Pulling out your ship access card you turn it over and dial the phone number
						printed on the back. As you access the voice mail service, you find that you
						have three messages.</p>
					<p>Playing the first message you hear a young man telling you that there have
						been no items returned to the ship's lost and found that match the
						description you gave. Your recall that you had asked for a reminder earlier
						hoping that someone would return the painting</p>
					<p>The second message is more of the same - a reminder message notifying you
						that still nothing has been returned.</p>
					<p>The last message is from Bernard. "Hi Travis," he says in a low monotone
						voice, "I'd like to speak with you. I'll be up at the 'Executive Room' until
						sunset. Please meet me there when you get this message." You recall that the
						Executive Room is a 'high class' club on the upper deck. Judging this as as
						good a time as any, you take a trip up the elevator to the club.</p>
					<p>Looking through the sliding crystal doors, you notice that the deep green
						wallpaper has golden silhouettes of polo players riding their horses.
						Looking over to the windows you notice Bernard sitting gazing out into the
						deep red sunset, just before it disappears over the horizon.</p>
					<p>You take a seat next to him. "Hello Bernard, I just received your message."
						"Ah, I see. Would you like something to drink," he says motioning to the
						waitress.</p>
					<p>"No, no thanks I'm good for now," you reply. He seems hesitant to start the
						conversation and takes a sip of what looks like whiskey or bourbon. "Let me
						tell you a story Travis," he begins looking at his drink as opposed to
						looking eye to eye.</p>
					<p>"A story about a man who saw too much. He was walking down a hallway one day
						and saw someone he knew. Just as he was about to walk up and say "hi" he
						notices this friend is just about to meet with someone, someone they both
						knew, but for the wrong reasons." he says.</p>
					<p>You get the feeling that this story has something to do with you. A pause
						ensues. The air becomes dry.</p>
					<p>"I saw you talking with Mark." Now Bernard is in fact looking you in the
						eye, searching for answers and your dealings with Mark come to mind. You
						think through your actions quickly from Bernard's perspective. "So you
						followed us?" you reply.</p>
					<p>"Yes I did, in fact I did more than just follow you. I am quite a good
						investigator as you know and I found out some anomalies in your data usage
						patterns in the last 12 hours."</p>
					<p>Now you know that your fate with Bernard has been sealed. He knows the truth
						and he has made no effort to conceal this. You realize that this is coming
						to a head right now.</p>
					<p>He begins again "I tell you this because I want you to know exactly where
						you went wrong. I'm an old man and I don't much care for secrets at this
						point, especially considering Sarah."</p>
					<p>You decide not to even make an attempt to justify your actions other than by
						saying "I was trying to find Sarah." Even this statement doesn't seem to
						roll off your tongue very easily as the truth is that you had your own
						interests at least partially in mind.</p>
					<p>Bernard can hear this in your voice as well. "Travis, I don't think that
						Mark will be telling you where Sarah is anytime soon. More than likely that
						man had something to do with her disappearance. You and I both know it. If
						your delusional enough to believe that then your a hazard to our team."</p>
					<p>The words strike you deep in your heart, you venture that Bernard caught a
						quick glimpse of this as well. He continues, "This is the end of my days as
						a private investigator and what a fitting ending it is. I lost one employee
						and was double-crossed by another."</p>
					<p>You both sit silent for a minute letting the emotion settle in. The aura of
						the sun now outlines the horizon after it passed down below the waterline.
						"I talked with Mark after your conversation." Bernard says, "he basically
						confirmed my suspicions. I don't know why you forced me onto the other side,
						but we are most definitely done." With this Bernard and you sit and watch as
						the aura from the sun passes away.</p>
					<p>You both get up and part ways.</p>
					<p>After the conversation you decide to go up and talk with Mark to see exactly
						how much Bernard told him. Knocking on his door he answers it but seems a
						little disturbed. "I talked with Bernard," you say.</p>
					<p>"Yes I did as well," Mark says, "I think that he has all the strings right
						at this moment, it is best for the both of us if we heed his warning."
						Without anymore words Mark slowly closes the door and you proceed down to
						your cabin.</p>
					<p>Your voyage on the QE2 is coming to an end shortly. You gather your things
						as the ship docks in Constantinople.</p>
					<p>As you're about to depart the ship there's a knocking on your cabin door.
						You open it to find Detective Farce and several police officers from the
						port authority. They spend several hours questioning you about the
						disappearance of Sarah, but fail to hit on any questions that you are not
						prepared to answer. After the interrogation you exit the ship and find a
						hotel in the area. You spend a couple of days continuing the search for
						Sarah, but to no avail.</p>
					<p>Returning back home the memory of Sarah is vivid in your mind. Much as
						Bernard said, you also feel that your desire to continue as a private
						investigator have disappeared with the loss of Sarah.</p>
					<p>You spend the next several years using the skills you've acquired to try to
						find her, but find nothing. The experience haunts you for many many years to
						come. The End.</p>

					<p>Looking into the bathroom mirror you notice the dark rings under your eyes.
						In fact, it's hard not to notice them as you've been up all night. In
						addition the borders around your eyes have a red tint to them, sure sign of
						a late night party animal, an insomniac, or something else.</p>
					<p>Through your head you've replayed the nights events a thousand times, with
						no clear indication of what should be done. At some point you'll have to
						sleep again, and will you return to the dream is the question.</p>
					<p>The parallel universe of the dream world and that of the ghostly world must
						interconnect. As with all dimensions there are limitations, so what are the
						limitations of the ghost realm?</p>
					<p>You've studied this topic while under Bernard's lead for quite some time,
						still with little clue as to the affect that ghosts can have on their
						physical surroundings. The evidence seems to show that ghosts can have a
						physical impact on this world, but it is unusual... very unusual. Usually
						ghosts are limited to tricks of the eyes and ears. They can create things
						that others can see and hear but not touch. Still this connection with the
						dream world has got you on edge. You have a coffee maker and a pound of
						coffee in your room, so should be alright for awhile.</p>
					<p>With a fresh cup of Joe in your hand even three hours of sleep is enough for
						you to make it through the day. You recall that the final auction while on
						the ship is scheduled for 11AM today. Is it worth the effort to go to the
						Auction?</p>

				<content>
					<p>Feeling the stress of the evening catching up with you, you decide to head
						back to your room. Picking the lock might have got you into the room, but
						this ship is filled with cameras and only select people know where they all
						are. Besides, is picking a lock to a utility closet going to get you closer
						to finding Sarah? You doubt so and head back to your cabin.</p>
				</content>
			</page>
			<page id="pg_containment_area" nextpage="pg_day_2">
				<decisionvar name="pg_containment_area" value="true"/>
				<content>
					<p>Clearly the ghosts are trying to speak to you so you decide to try and pick
						the lock. You reach into your pocket and pull out a very small wrap of what
						looks like metal twigs. You carefully unroll the set of tools and pick a
						couple of pieces then get to work on the lock. A couple of minutes later the
						door clicks and the handle moves freely. The door is open.</p>
					<p>As the door slides open a thin layer of fog on the floor rolls out of the
						room. It has no odor and a light slowly pulsating blue ting to it. "Another
						apparition from a parallel world?" you wonder. Not completely satisfied with
						your answer you move on.</p>
					<p>The room is a storage closet with several rows of shelfs. The shelfs contain
						ancient bottles of cleaning supplies and maintenance materials. This must
						have been the junk closet for anything and everything related to maintenance
						of this level. The labels on many of the cleaning supplies look like their
						time had come and gone from an era long past.</p>
					<p>You can see a dim red light past all of the boxes and shelfs that clutter
						the closet space. Looking for a light switch around the door doesn't come up
						with any answers so you force your way into the closet making sure to close
						the door behind you in case anyone happens down the hall. Stepping past the
						shelving units the closet opens up into a full room with maintenance
						machinery and an ere red light coming from the back corner. The red light
						silhouettes a string that hangs from the ceiling. This must be the light
						switch. You pull the string, the lights turn on, and find yourself standing
						in the middle of a work area far larger than you had expected for a closet.
						You see a flashlight on the work table. Fortunately it still works so you
						hold onto it.</p>
					<p>A blue glow starts to radiate from the corner of the room, right next to the
						red light. You look back in the corner and realize that this is a freight
						elevator. The kind where you pull down a grated door in the front. You
						decide to take a closer look and step into the elevator. The pulsating blue
						glow comes from the control panel.</p>
					<p>Grabbing up to the ceiling you pull the overhead door downward. It hits the
						floor with a thud. Underneath you can hear the echo of the sound flowing
						down the shaft and back up. It sounds like an awfully long way down. You
						click the glowing button and the elevator lurches downward in waves,
						sometimes smooth sometimes rough. Looking up you can see the light from the
						room above shrink into a rectangular outline far above. You're so far away
						from the light that you find it hard to believe that you're still in the
						ship, but you must be you figure. Darkness engulfs you. Finally the elevator
						stops. With flashlight in hand you find the handle for the gate and open it.</p>
					<p>The air is stale. The cone of light given off by the flashlight seems to do
						little to help you make sense of this place. Then you see another ghostly
						blue glowing light around the corner. Guessing that this is a sign you make
						your way around the corner and find yourself in front of a very large metal
						container attached to the wall. The blue glow is coming from a lever at the
						end of the box. This is an electrical system of some sort, and you guess
						that the handle will activate the electricity in this area. You pull the
						handle</p>
					<p>One by one in rows of nine the lighting in this chamber comes on line. You
						can hear a loud buzzing sound as each of the banks of lights turn on all the
						way down the length of chamber. It is huge! The rounded halls of the ship
						comes down on either side of the room forming a gentle U shape along the
						area. You realize that this is the bottom of the ship.</p>
					<p>What is this place here for and why does it lead down from the closet
						upstairs? Something is awry here. You need more clues, so you start looking
						for anything that might catch your eye as to what was happening here. As you
						scan the area you see machinery and makeshift rooms with girders and rivets
						holding the place together. Then you see something else, a person, a woman,
						a young woman in a blue sun dress, and she seems to be looking at you as
						well. If it weren't for the dream earlier this would have been the last
						thing you ever would have thought of seeing in a grimy factory area like
						this.</p>
					<p>She stands waiting for you as you approach her. No words pass between you,
						she turns and points to a book on a desk table. You open it and see various
						signatures with hundreds of dates and times recorded in it. This is a
						logbook of some sort. You pick it up and look back to the young woman, but
						she is gone now, disappeared as quickly as she had appeared.</p>
					<p>Holding the log book in hand you decide that you've had enough for the
						evening and start making your way back to the elevator. The solitude of this
						area is disturbing. The creaking forces acting on the hull of the ship speak
						of the tragedies the ship has witnessed. You pull the power relay and step
						into the elevator. The lights turn off row by row in the exact opposite of
						how they were enabled.</p>
					<p>You return to your cabin.</p>

					<p>Still in bed and looking at the blue flames you realize that this could be
						anything. It might lead you to the girl, but who is to say if the girl would
						help you find Sarah, or if this is some sort of trap. The risks are too high
						and with Sarah already missing and no evidence of where she may have gone
						to, you must assume that these ghosts may not be friendly at all.</p>
					<p>In your heart you know that this is not the last time while on board that
						the ghosts will attempt to reach out to you. You realize that you feel
						unprepared for a more serious and direct confrontation.</p>
					<p>Now what to do about the blue flames. You turn on your bedside light to have
						a closer look. Suddenly the flames disappear completely. Slowly you get out
						of your bed and put on your rob. Opening the cabin door you view down the
						dimmed hallway. No flames are present so you close the door.</p>

				<content>
					<p>Gathering up your courage you get out of bed. The light from the blue flames
						fills the room with enough light to find all of your clothes. After putting
						your clothes on you walk to the cabin door careful not to touch the flames.
						As you open the door the dimmed lights from the hallway start casting into
						the room and the flames disappear.</p>
					<p>You look down the hallway in both directions and see nothing on the first
						look. Then you notice a blue flame in the dark area between two lights. The
						lights down the corridor are generally regularly spaced, but not always, as
						in this case. There is a corner that is partially darkened. In this corner
						you can see the blue flames. You close and lock the door to your room and
						head down the hallway to the patch of flame. From there it points down
						another corridor and you quickly follow.</p>
					<p>As your rounding the entryway to the lobby area you realize that it is
						completely empty. Not a soul in sight. The blue flame is there and guides up
						the the closed double doors of a lobby elevator. On the button console the
						down button is glowing a pulsing blue color that cast a blue light across
						the hallway to the glass walls lining the ships hall.</p>
					<p>The double glass doors to the elevator open and you walk inside, looking
						around one final time to see if anyone is present. The panel in the elevator
						has a button glowing an eiry blue color. It is the bottom button for this
						elevator and goes two stories lower than the lobby level. You press the
						button and the elevator moves you down. You descend down past the lobby
						floor in a glass tube. As you're coming to the lower floor you can see the
						blue flames trailing down the corridor.</p>
					<p>You come to rest on the lower floor, the doors to the elevator open and you
						look out to the blue flames. You step out and follow them around a corner
						down a very dim hallway. The flames end with the end of the hallway in front
						of a locked door.</p>
					<p>You have two choices you figure, you can try and pick the lock, or you can
						head back to your room. Security cameras don't appear to be in the area, but
						now a days you never quite know if theirs one hiding around. Either way
						picking a lock could get you in some serious trouble if found. What do you
						do?</p>

					<p>During the night Sarah materializes inviting you into the world of dreams.
						She motions with her hands as she walks toward the extravagant stair cases
						of the main lobby area. Glass elevators are filled with people in formal
						attire about to enjoy an evening of dancing and dining at several locations
						on the ship. A good time for all.</p>
					<p>Small lights line the hallways and encircle the balconies in a vivid field
						of stars. The main lights of the lobby area are dimmed a bit to accentuate
						the feeling of being in a star studded universe vastly different than the
						average. The details are not forgotten, you can tell that this is a creation
						of several talented architects layered on year after year. Mirrors line the
						ledge spaces between balconies forming complete circles. The Mediterranean
						guitar music wafts up from the lobby floor area that has been converted into
						a stage.</p>
					<p>Sarah notices you falling behind entangled by the beauty of the scene. You
						speed up to ask her a question. As you move forward faster, she moves faster
						as well. You're behind her trying to make your way through the crowd.</p>
					<p>A surge of people coming from the forward theater makes moving difficult.
						You realize that Sarah is moving farther ahead. You try to push your way
						through the crowd, with little luck. The hallway is jammed, as crowds of
						people wait for the elevator. As you make your way through the crowd slowly
						and surely, you look up and try to spot Sarah. You don't see her</p>
					<p>After a couple of minutes you've moved your way through the crowd to the
						hallway intersection that you saw Sarah follow. Confronted with the choice
						of directions you don't know what to do. Looking up and down the hallway you
						can see nothing either way. Tension rises. "Why didn't Sarah wait for me?"
						No answer comes to mind.</p>
					<p>Looking down the hallway you see what looks like a blue flame.. on the
						floor.. OF THE SHIP! You run down the hallway at a sprint to try and put out
						the fire. As you get closer you notice that the fire doesn't seem to be
						burning anything. No obnoxious odors are present. "What is going on here?"
						you wonder.</p>
					<p>Then you see the young woman from the top deck walk by. Looking around you
						realize that you and this young woman are the only people in the hallway at
						this moment. She walks toward you and shyly looks up to you. The bags under
						her eyes are dark as if life has been a dark occurrence for her. She seems
						scared, frighten-able, delicate but determined.</p>
					<p>You say nothing. The fire is still burning on the ground but she seems to
						take no notice. She says your name slowly looking you in the eyes "T r a v i
						s". You don't like this situation so you start to step back. Her blue sun
						dress ruffles as if a wind is passing through it... in the hallway... How
						strange you think.</p>
					<p>The fire, the dress, the girl, Sarah. Even in the trance of sleep you
						realize that this is a dream and you stop believing and fall distant to what
						appears to be the present. The dream fades into darkness and you wake from
						it</p>
					<p>You realize that your hands and feet are ice cold and your t-shirt is moist
						from sweat. The covers are off the bed and you half open your eyes to see
						what time it is.</p>
					<p>The clock says 3:45, but there is something else. The glass face of your
						bedside clock has a radiating blue reflection. You open your eyes completely
						and look around the room. The roof is still dark, but the walls are
						radiating an irregular blue tone.</p>
					<p>Rising from your bed you see a line of blue flames leading to the door. A
						thin line. Your dream had prepared you for this. It had prepared you for
						something else as well. "The girl! Where is she?" you wonder. She's out
						there somewhere, outside your room. You know that these flames will lead you
						to her. Do you follow?</p>

					<p>"Bernard, I met this guy down in one of the ship lounges, the Butterfly
						Lounge to be more exact. He's a painter named Rudolphe Thornsden and several
						of his paintings have been auctioned off on this ship. He sounded kind of
						strange, like his painting are more then just what they appear to be. It
						sounded like his family was involved in this for some reason. Just wanted to
						pass this on."</p>
					<p>"Hum, interesting," Bernard replies. "Things seem to be pointing to that
						Auction House as if it were something more than just a pastime for the
						passenger. Maybe there's some sort of mafia connection, money laundering or
						something. Keep your ears open for anymore information about it."</p>

						When a good image is found of the person in question a computer scans the

					<p>You knock on Bernard's door. "Who is it?" you hear him say. "Travis," you
						say loudly through the door. "Come on in."</p>
					<p>As you open the door you walk into the room Bernard says from the lavatory
						"Be one second." You take this opportunity to sit at the desk and review
						your notes.</p>
					<p>Seeing the note you wrote about the girl in the blue sun dress reminded you
						of that night, of the dream. You flash back to the vision of the girl's
						face, half transparent, half opaque. You think back to her movements. She
						looked like a teenage girl put much older, ancient even. "Why was she chosen
						for this task? And, by whom? How do the spirits of the ghost world come to
						these decisions?"</p>
					<p>Your brain has trouble working against the facts to make sense of what
						you've witnessed. There is one thing that you seem sure of, you didn't fully
						understand the girl or what she was trying to tell you.</p>
					<p>Then you look up to see Bernard washing his hands in the sink. "Some more
						sightings of Mr. Liang came through today. It seems that he's well connected
						with important people on this ship." Bernard slips Travis a picture of Mr.
						Liang talking with a middle aged white haired gentlemen. "That other person
						is Ian Brookstoll, a very interesting character. He's a member of the board
						for the parent company that hold rights to this ship. Of course the British
						government can step in at any time, such as they did in World War II, but
						his corporation administers the day to day operations most of the time."</p>
					<p>Bernard slips you another image of Mr. Liang walking into a room. "It
						appears that Mr. Liang also knows Mark Drisden." Of course the picture is a
						gritty security camera photo which clearly shows Mark and Mr. Liang.</p>

					<p>Bernard opens the door and you walk in. He pours himself a drink as you take
						a seat on the bed. Walking back to his computer he sits down. "Travis" he
						says, "Is this Mr. Liang?" pointing to an image on his computer screen. You
						look over. The picture shows a man from the front with a slight downward
						angle to the image. His eyes are clear, and his features are distinct. The
						figure is not wearing sun glasses or a hat.</p>
					<p>You move closer to get a better look. The distinctive characteristics of the
						upper lip and chin confirm your initial suspicion. "Yes, I think this is Mr.
						Liang. Where did you get this?". Bernard seems to pretend that he didn't
						hear your question. "Great then!" he says, "We have a match.". "We should
						have a match to all the security cameras on the ship within a couple of
						hours. If he's walking around with his face completely exposed like this,
						he'll be picked up by the facial recognition system."</p>

					<p>As Bernard opens the door he realizes that it's you and barely acknowledges
						you. He turns to walk back into the room leaving the door open. You get the
						point, you missed the planned time for investigating the Auction House. You
						close the door and take a seat.</p>
					<p>"I'm sure you had something important to do but we have to respect each
						other's time if we're going to work together," Bernard says. You apologize
						but get the feeling that apologies don't get you very far with Bernard.</p>
					<p>"I called in some favors for this job. You made me look bad Travis." He moves
						to his mini bar and pours himself a drink. "I went to the Auction House. I
						made it all the way to the safe, but wasn't able to crack it. I could have
						used your help on this operation. You're the locksmith not me, so I'm
						thinking it was your fault we didn't get the information." He takes another
						drink and looks at you with a disappointed glance. "If anything like this
						happens again... that will be the last time".</p>
					<p>You decided to bite your tongue on this, and realize that you and Bernard
						might be parting ways before too long if you pull something like this
						again.</p>

					<p>Bernard opens the door and motions for you to come in. For lack of many
						seating options you sit on the bed. Bernard sits in front of his laptop. The
						screen is bright and the room is dark.</p>
					<p>He motions for you to come over. You get up, walk over, and look over his
						shoulder. He seems to be looking at a satellite image of some sort. "There!"
						he says and motions to a lower right corner of the image. "The names in the
						log book correspond with the course of this ship more than 30 years ago".
						It's hard to imagine that Bernard has access to satellite images from 30
						years ago. Shoot, it's hard to imagine that there were satellite images 30
						years ago, but there were, and Bernard has access to them.</p>
					<p>Bernard says "This log book seems to run about 25 years. During that time
						they had roughly 11,000 people on this boat in that cargo area. These were
						soldiers, and probably armed and highly trained. The QE2 was more than just
						a passenger ship, it was a military troop transport. probably for covert
						operations. Many of the dates and times center around the middle east. Your
						ghost friend was right, this ship has a story to tell far below the
						aristocratic upper levels."</p>
					<p>"There are some references in this book that make me think that there is
						even more to this story. Look here," Bernard points to a reference to a word
						that looks suspiciously close to "torpedo". "Is it possible that the Queen
						Elizabeth II has torpedo hatches? It seems like someone would have figured
						it out when it was dry docked." You think that it's hard to imagine, but
						then again you've not heard mention of any troop transport area in belly of
						the ship either.</p>
					<p>Bernard looks to you again. "We should find out, this could be valuable
						information to us, especially considering Sarah is missing. Maybe she's down
						there Travis. Maybe the ghost wanted to show you but couldn't for some
						reason. We should check this out". You think it's pretty far fetched, but
						the boat will dock here shortly and every hour counts. Is this really going
						to help you find Sarah?</p>

				<content>
					<p>You sit quietly for a minute or two letting the words from Bernard's story
						sink in. Smoke from Bernard's cigarette lingers through the air in curls
						that reminds you of spotting shapes in clouds when you were a kid. The
						curling cycles swirl with the unseen current of air circulating in the room.</p>
					<p>You hand Bernard the book that you recovered from the the cargo area. He
						looks at you as you hand it asking "What's this?" You tell him that you
						don't quite know. You mention that the young woman you saw pointed to it and
						disappeared after you had grabbed it. "It appears to be some sort of log
						book. I haven't really looked at it since last night.</p>
					<p>Bernard thumbs through the pages, each page is filled from the very top of
						the page to the very bottom in small writing. Some text takes up a full
						line, much of the text uses half lines around the borders of the page. Even
						the binding had text scribbled into it.. You both sit there for a good hour
						trying to figure out exactly what this book is about.</p>
					<p>Bernard breaks out his computer and his satellite connection. Even out here
						on the ocean you're not beyond the reach of the satellites overhead. He's up
						on the Internet, looking up names, cross checking facts. You're helping out
						by reading off unique names and places. Dates flow through the book like a
						broken timeline that starts from the beginning of the book, goes to the end,
						and then starts over using the smaller text written in the margins of the
						page at the start of the book and going again to the end.</p>
					<p>The dates seem to cover a time span of some 25 years. Bernard asks you if
						this was the only log book that you saw there. You nod your head. The names
						keep on flowing and soon you realize that this book kept track of personal
						items of individuals. Probably the individuals that were passengers on the
						boat in that cargo hold.</p>
					<p>You have trouble believing that someone would actually travel down in that
						area. A passenger on this ship surely wouldn't. Then, the thought crosses
						you mind... a passenger as we presume them to be wouldn't travel like that,
						but someone who is forced to travel down there could live out the journey.
						You recall the scraps of uniformed clothing lying around the area. "Maybe
						these were soldiers!" you presume to Bernard.</p>
					<p>Bernard pauses, "Good point, what I'm finding here definitely would fit that
						picture. This ship must have been a troop transport of some sort. Covertly
						shipping soldiers around the world." The story starts to unravel. By this
						time you realize that an hour has passed. You also realize that you have
						other priorities to attend to and Bernard mentions that he'll continue to
						find out more about the mystery of this logbook.</p>
					<p>As you're leaving Bernard's room he says "I'm thinking that we should both
						take a trip down to this cargo area. The inhabitants of this ship seem to be
						interested in telling us a story. We should not disappoint".</p>
					<p>On that disturbing note you leave the room.</p>

					<p>You can tell that Bernard doesn't like this situation one bit.</p>
					<p>He leans back in his chair and starts to speak. Bernard tells you a story
						about a job he was on back in the 70's with a group of young investigators
						such as himself at the time. He tells you that they were sent out to verify
						the contents of freight shipments on a container ship. There had been some
						disappearances of valuable cargo on the open sea.</p>
					<p>There were two other investigators with Bernard. They would take shifts
						monitoring the containers, and setting traps to lure in prospective thieves.
						The idea was that if they could get the thieves to break into one of these
						containers, there would be a camera waiting for them along with a loud
						siren.</p>
					<p>One night one of the sirens when off. Bernard happened to be on duty at that
						time. He ran down to the dummy container, and slowed down as he rounded the
						corner. He had a side arm and he drew it, expecting to apprehend the
						perpetrator.</p>
					<p>The lights in the container were flashing, the horn was going, the door was
						open, and the camera had taken a single photo.</p>
					<p>He was spooked that he saw no one there, so he turned off the horn, the
						lights, and took the camera. Then he closed the container door, not even
						bothering to lock it.</p>
					<p>That night he developed the film in his cabin bathroom. As the film was
						materializing he thought he had underexposed it. But the surroundings were
						contrasted perfectly.</p>
					<p>He stood there in the glow of the red light, watching as an image
						materialized of a woman in cruising attire started to take shape. There was
						only one problem; you could see through her....</p>
					<p>He immediately woke up the others to show them the image. The next day they
						all went down to the container. It had been painted in blood with words that
						none of them could decipher.</p>
					<p>As soon as they ported in Egypt they handed the photos off to the shipping
						representatives in the port. They all looked puzzled except for one person,
						a tall older man who had been working that ship for 20 years. He seemed to
						understand what it meant. He explained that it was the ghost known only as
						Esmeralda.</p>
					<p>Bernard proceeds to tell you Esmeralda's story. She was a welder in the ship
						yards where the ship was put together. She died on that ship before it even
						touched the water. He did not know the exact story, but he did know that she
						was not happy with her treatment there.</p>
					<p>Bernard turns white as he's telling the story. He says "And now it's back".
						As a PI you have to take the path that may lead down to things you wish not
						to know. And that is the only time Bernard has truly felt that the standard
						rules have to be bent to understand the mind of the apparition.</p>
					<p>He tells you, "You cannot expect to connect the dots like you usually do.
						You must thinks outside of the dimensions of this world."</p>

					<p>Bernard realizes that you are visibly shaken and pours you a glass of water.
						He asks you "What's up?".</p>
					<p>It takes quite a bit of effort for the words to come out of your mouth, but
						slowly you tell Bernard about the blue flames, the dream that you had about
						Sarah, and meeting the girl in the hallway.</p>

					<p>As you start to gather your tools to leave, the lights start to tilt and
						seem to bend to the darkness in waves. You see something around the small
						buildings lining the hall. A shadowy outline quickly stretches across the
						catwalks of this area, then disappears. Bernard saw it as well and motions
						to the gun in his utility bag. Since you're the closest to the bag you grab
						it and tuck it behind your back in between your belt and body.</p>
					<p>You hear something. It sounds like an argument. Suddenly a soldier with a
						machine gun comes slowly moping out. You are within site but he seems not to
						see you. He's in an argument with what sounds like another soldier. The
						language sounds middle eastern, the soldier seems like a relic from the
						World War II era. He still doesn't seem to notice you both. You look
						questioningly at Bernard. Bernard decides it's time to talk and yells
						"Hello!". The soldier still doesn't respond. Bernard says again "Hello, who
						are you?" Still nothing. After that you both stop with the pleasantries for
						you realize that this enactment was for you. They want you to see.</p>
					<p>You watch observantly as the haggard soldier continues to banter with
						someone in the building. He pulls out a picture and looks at it then puts it
						away. He is lonely, he is tired, he starts to disassemble his weapon and
						clean it. It already looks spotless. How long has he been here you wonder.
						You guess that it's been months. A voice yells out to the soldier, "Where
						did you put him?". "He's over there!" the soldier yells back pointing his
						finger toward a small building against the hull. The arguing stops and the
						soldier vanishes. You and Bernard start to slowly move toward the room while
						keeping your hand on the gun tucked in your trousers. You move past where
						the soldier was and feel a strong force lifting up the hairs on your neck.
						You come to a door, an office door with letters on the glass 'Infirmary".
						The door is ajar so you open it. Creaking its way open you step into the
						room.</p>
					<p>The ghost had warned you for what you might find appropriately. There is a
						man tied to a chair with a piece of cloth around his mouth. Unlike the ghost
						this man seems very real. He is unconscious, and has a large bruise down his
						neck. "We're in over our head" you mutter to Bernard who seems to agree.
						Alone, in the belly of a large ship civilization becomes a different thing,
						like a suggestion as opposed to a fact. If something were to happen here no
						one would know, and no one would ever find you. This man in the chair is
						proof to that. He looks to have been left for dead, until you both showed
						up.</p>
					<p>You grab your canteen and walk over stomping your feet to wake the man up if
						he still had that ability. His eyes open. Fearful eyes with sharp pupils
						search for the object in your hand. You put your hands out to show that you
						are not here to hurt him, and he seems to understand. Moving over to the
						chair you remove the cloth from his mouth and offer him some water. He
						drinks a bit and says nothing. Although his face is a bit damaged you
						recognize him. Rudolphe Thornsden, the painter you met at the butterfly
						lounge.</p>
					<p>Releasing his bonds you give him a bite of food that you packed. He doesn't
						have much energy but you think that you can support him back to the
						elevator. "We need to move," Bernard whispers, and working as a team you
						grab Rudolphe and some of his belonging and make your way for the elevator.
						Bernard throws the power lever turning the lights off and the elevator makes
						its way up to the closet. Moving through the closet is a bit difficult with
						Rudolphe, but is manageable.</p>
					<p>As you're making your way to Bernard's room Rudolphe motions with his hand
						to another route. "The cellar, it is safe, we can talk there," You and
						Bernard quickly decide to trust Rudolphe and make way for the cellar. He
						shows you the back route leading through the crew passages decorated with
						none of the finery of the passenger levels. You come to a dimly lit corner
						room. Rudolphe pulls out his keys and fumbles for the appropriate one. You
						grab it and open the door. Moving into the room Rudolphe locks the door
						behind you all, and wobbles for a seat. There is a table back between wooden
						drums with a single light. Rudolphe moves to a small refrigerator and grabs
						cubes of ice and rolls them into an ice pack. "What did I do to deserve this
						you ask?" he says to you both. "I've payed my loyalties and am a free man,
						so I will tell you in detail what I did. But, first tell me your story. Why
						were you down there?"</p>
					<p>Feeling that the truth would get you further than withholding information
						(and possibly closer to finding Sarah as well) you tell Rudolphe about the
						ghostly dream and the blue flame leading you to the area below the ship. You
						mention the image of the soldier leading you to where Rudolphe was. He
						slowly says in somewhat broken English which was not helped by his facial
						swelling. "I have witnessed things on this ship as well that defy reasoning.
						I thank you for risking uncertainty to get me back here. This ship has many
						secrets, and I will tell you some of them right here."</p>
					<p>He goes onto say "With the delivery of that final painting my dept has been
						fulfilled, and the curse that this has been on my family for the last 40
						years is completed. The people who did this to me made a decision to
						eliminate me because I am no longer needed. They are wrong. The painting
						that I told you about earlier, you bid on it right?" You nod your head.
						Rudolphe says "They know who you are, they know why you bid up the painting.
						They guessed correctly that I was the leak and left me to die down there as
						my punishment. I told them that I didn't divulge any useful information, but
						that didn't seem to matter to them."</p>
					<p>"My family has kept the secret safe for 40 years and this is how they repay
						us."</p>
					<p>You and Bernard are a bit confused. "So they were going to kill you over a
						painting?" you ask.</p>
					<p>"The painting is only the surface." Rudolphe replies, "Under the painting,
						in the painting, this is the key. There were 7 paintings, each one with a
						different aspect of the riddle. Together they form a final key to this ship
						a key to the ghostly dimensions. Once the keys are put together a gate is
						formed. If you pass through the gate you will reappear in the world of the
						spirits." Both you and Bernard understand his words correctly and are
						stunned.</p>
					<p>Judging that Rudolphe may have had a bit too much for the day you and
						Bernard decide to cut the conversation short and stand up from your chairs.
						"So you can pass into the ghostly world? What exactly does that buy you?".</p>
					<p>"The truth!" Rudolphe replies. "In the world of the living the truth is a
						changing stream. In other dimensions the truth is absolute and never
						changes."</p>
					<p>The events have been exhausting for you all so you decide to meet together
						again later. You ask Rudolphe if there is anything they can do to help hide
						him. He looks at you both and says "I've know this ship for most of my life.
						My family helped build it. I will be invisible here". He motions to a small
						corridor in the corner. "These air ducks network through the ship like a
						web. I will need your assistance later on, until then be safe friends." With
						that you part ways and head back to Bernard's room.</p>

					<p>Bernard heads toward the elevator. You decide to follow. You can tell that
						something spooked him, but what? Another ghost? You guess not, instead you
						think that it was something a little closer to home. Something from this
						world. Bernard shuts down the lights and you both enter the elevator with
						flashlight in hand.</p>
					<p>Back at Bernard's cabin you unpack your gear and Bernard tells you about the
						footprint. He also shows you the document he took. It's an invoice of some
						sort sent to "Trans Atlantic Corp", it had a "Paid" stamp mark in red across
						it.</p>
					<p>You're not sure what to make of this, but Bernard seems to have ideas.
						"What's this?" you ask him. "Not sure. I have a feeling that these troop
						shipments were a private endeavor. Basically, the troops and equipment were
						on loan. I'll have more answers for you before too long."</p>

					<p>Unlike previously, this time you and Bernard will be prepared. You head back
						to your cabin to get your things assembled.</p>
					<p>Scurrying around the room, you gather anything you think might come in
						handy: camera, one million candle watt light, first aid pack, knife.</p>
					<p>Returning to Bernard's cabin, you see that he's grabbed some useful
						equipment: EMF gauges, thermal sensors, motion detectors, and an assortment
						of other toys. You look at each other eye to eye and nod, it is time to go.
						You head out the door.</p>
					<p>You take the elevator down to the utility closet, following the same path
						that you took the first time. As you approach the door, Bernard stays back
						making sure that the coast is clear while you pick the lock in record time.</p>
					<p>You open the door and Bernard moves inside. Carefully you close the door,
						making sure not to make too much noise. Switching on your flashlights, you
						move to the back of the room. Bernard searches the shelves looking for
						anything that might be useful. Nothing springs to his attention so he joins
						you in the freight elevator. You press the button and the elevator lurches
						forward. After what seems like 10 minutes the elevator finally comes to a
						stop. You're at the bottom.</p>
					<p>You open the elevator door and Bernard moves around the corner, finding the
						light switch. Once again the banks of lights turn on in sequence. As the
						lights turn on, bank by bank, Bernard looks to you in amazement. "I can't
						believe this. The size. How has this possibly stayed a secret for so many
						years?" You shrug your shoulders and move toward the desk where you find the
						log book. You can see dust clouds swirling around the lights. Judging from
						the grime on the desk, this place hasn't been used for decades. "I wouldn't
						be surprised if this place was forgotten long ago." Surely someone had been
						into the closet leading to the elevator, but had anyone really looked around
						the closet? Had anyone really stuck their head behind the heavy metal
						shelving to find the elevator hidden in the corner? Probably not for a very
						long while. Even if someone did, would they dare step out of the elevator
						when it touched down on the belly of the ship? It is possible, but not very
						probable, unless someone was sent here with a specific task.</p>
					<p>Bernard pulls out his EMF gauge and starts it up. The device beeps
						repeatedly. He says "The numbers are really high here. Maybe the energy of
						the ship accumulates down here at the bottom. He casually strolls around the
						area with EMF in hand.</p>
					<p>As he approaches a rectangular metal box the beeping starts to increase. He
						moves closer, you can hear a buzzing from the container. "It's an old
						transformer with a short," he mutters. Wires are headed out of the
						transformer and Bernard start to track them down. They lead into a cabin in
						the very center of the room. Catwalks lead up to the cabin and looking down
						you can see the buildup from sludge in the hull underneath the cabin. Oddly,
						the room seems like it sits on a metal foundation that stretches all the way
						down to the hull of the ship. Metal rivets attach it to the hull very
						securely. You wonder if it's over-engineering at its best.</p>
					<p>You follow Bernard into the room and notice what looks like a giant vat in
						the middle. Bernard notices this too and takes the catwalk up over the lip
						of the vat. He stops and without saying a word motions to you to come up as
						well. You follow and look over the ledge of the vat. "This is a submarine,"
						you whisper to Bernard. "Unbelievable," he replies back. You quickly pull
						out your camera and snap a picture. "I bet they didn't even use the
						elevator, I bet they moved people using this sub. Hell, most of the people
						here probably didn't even know what ship they were on."</p>
					<p>The reality of the situation is that you and Bernard could spend days
						combing this area for clues, but time is key right now, and time is one
						thing that you don't have. "When this ship docks in port, it's going to be
						nearly impossible to find Sarah," you mention. Bernard looks at you slowly
						and realizes the correctness of your statement. "Just give me five more
						minutes", he tells you. You agree and he moves back to the desk area and
						follows another path into the buildings lining the sides of the hull. He
						moves down the catwalks quickly, all the time searching for additional
						documentation to explain happened here.</p>
					<p>He moves past an office area and opens the door. The room is filthy, the
						dust is thick in the air. The file cabinets have been forced open and
						tumbled on the ground in the middle of the room. Files are strewn around the
						office. Something startles Bernard. As he shines his flashlight into a
						corner he notices a footprint. A fresh, pristine footprint. Someone has been
						here, and not too long ago. With that he quickly rummages through the
						paperwork, and pulls something out. He comes back to you "We need to leave
						right now!" Bernard says.</p>

					<p>Bernard realizes that you are visibly shaken and pours you a glass of water.
						He asks you "What's up?". It takes quite a bit of effort for the words to
						come out of your mouth but slowly you tell Bernard about the blue flames and
						the ghost leading you down into the bowels of the ship.</p>
					<p>You then tell him how you followed the ghost and how the ghost pointed you

				<decisionvar name="pg_tell_Bernard_not_first_PIs" value="true"/>
				<content>
					<p>Deciding to break the news to Bernard isn't an easy task. There is, of
						course, the possibility that Bernard is in on the whole devious plan, and
						knew that you both weren't the first PI's on the ship. You still trust
						Bernard to some extent, but this mounting uncertainty is making you more and
						more uncomfortable. This journey has not turned out as you'd expected, by
						any stretch of the imagination, and this leads you to doubt everyone, even
						yourself.</p>
					<p>You decide to aim a simple question to test Bernard's response and help calm
						your fears.</p>
					<p>You say "Bernard, I was doing some research and ran across some interesting
						information. It appears that we're not the first PI's on this ship. Of
						course I imagine that thousands of PI's have traveled this ship, but how
						many have been sent here to investigate the ship itself? Have you heard
						anything about this?". Your eyes drill into Bernard, emphasizing that this
						is a very serious question that requires a serious answer. No time for
						joking around, the answer here will determine your future working together.
						Bernard has worked with you long enough to know when you're serious, even
						though you've asked the question very lightly.</p>
					<p>Bernard returns you gaze. "What are you talking about Travis? Do you know
						something that I don't? Spit it out if that's the case." You seem a bit
						satisfied with his answer. The tone in his voice sounded genuine, and his
						reaction was what you'd expect from Bernard.</p>
					<p>"Ya, I felt the same way when I heard the news," you reply. "Bernard, we both
						know that there are ghosts here, but there is more to it than just that.
						They are coming out from their hiding places in the other dimensions now,
						because now matters to them. Somehow they're tied to this ship. They expect
						something is going to happen, and are making contact with the world of the
						living to force an issue of some sort.</p>
					<p>"I talked with one of the ghosts down by the pool area. She told me in no
						uncertain terms that we are not unique here. We are the second wave of
						investigators on this ship. So what happened to the first wave? Bernard!
						They were lost at sea and never seen again! They DIED!" Your hands start to
						shake as you deliver the line, and take a seat on the bed to steady your
						nerves.</p>
					<p>Bernard gets fidgety as well an rests his head on his hand on the chair arm.
						Still being uncomfortable he moves to the balcony and watches the ocean roll
						by to calm his nerves. The room feels small and dirty and stuffy. The heat
						seems to stick to you. All this was unnoticeable beforehand, but suddenly
						the ship is starting to feel like a prison and the confined area feels
						uncomfortable. The same feeling that someone on death row might feel, like
						your life might be wrapping up soon, and this is where it will happen, in a
						small stuffy cabin. You try to push the thought out of your mind.</p>
					<p>"So you know this for sure?" Bernard asks. "As sure as you can trust a ghost,
						I guess. She didn't seem like she needed to lie to me. She seemed like she
						was doing me a favor by enlightening me to the situation," you reply.</p>
					<p>"We need to change our tactics." Bernard says. "This is no longer an
						investigation, we are done with that route. We need to find Sarah and get
						the hell out of here. Do you think Central knew? Did that ghost say anything
						about that?" Bernard asks.</p>
					<p>"No she didn't. Not even a clue. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprise if Central
						didn't know either. If they did though... if they knew full well that they
						were sending us into a war zone without us knowing. Then..." you catch
						yourself mid sentence, knowing that the words don't need to be spoken aloud.
						Bernard and you will rip through that organization with no mercy until you
						find information leading to the people who did know. In the digital age,
						getting away with crimes is easier for some, but much more difficult for
						most. There's always data available somewhere that can be shared with the
						entire world, exposing what your up to at any given time. You and Bernard
						know how to peel that data back like an onion, and have done so on many
						occasions. Your network of computer hackers and network infiltration
						specialists will find the answers. Sarah is missing, possibly dead. Had the
						ghosts not warned you, you realize that you might be the next ones.</p>
					<p>No words are exchanged but you can feel the tension building. The new game is
						survival and you and Bernard are probably good at this game, you realize.
						Bernard moves to the closet and opens up a bag filled with equipment. "Keep
						this on you at all times." Bernard says and hands you a walkie-talkie.
						"Don't worry, I don't think they have the equipment aboard to track your
						location from this. It's a frequency hopper with encryption, so you can at
						least feel that safe about it. If you run into any trouble don't hesitate.
						It has a vibrate mode on it as well so it won't be that obvious if you get a
						ping from me. It should work anywhere on the ship. Any questions?"</p>
					<p>You take the device and shake your head no. He then hands you a taser from
						the bag. "Police issued so don't fuck around and shock yourself. This will
						put down an horse on level 10, so keep it around 4 at most." He points to a
						little knob on the top. You're amazed that Bernard was able to get all this
						stuff through customs and ask him just that. Bernard replies "Umm can't
						really say, just be happy we got it." Which is a good enough answer for
						you.</p>
					<p>Bernard then moves over to the mattress and picks it up moving it halfway off
						the bed. Underneath the mattress are a line of boards, one of which is
						loose. He moves the loose board and reaches his hand down into the platform
						the mattress lays on, pulling out a soft carrying case just the right size
						for a firearm. Looking up to you he shows you the case without bringing it
						out from inside the platform. "If you need it, it's in here and there's some
						extra ammo down there as well." He moves it back to where it is cradled
						inside the platform. "I'll know if you move it so don't unless you need to."
						Your paranoia lifts a little as Bernard shows you a bit of trust by telling
						you this. You nod in agreement, "Good deal."</p>
					<p>Bernard says "The best thing we can do at this point is lay low for the rest
						of the trip. Unfortunately this isn't help us find Sarah though, so I don't
						know what to say. Keep that radio on you at all times, and be careful. I'll
						do some investigating and see what I can pull up about the prior group. I
						might have to pull some strings with the Royal Navy, but what are strings
						for if you can't pull them from time to time. That's the best I can do."</p>
					<p>"Also," He says "Remember! YOU ARE ON A SHIP. If you draw that weapon just
						remember that you might put a hole in it. If you're below sea level be very
						cautious. One poorly placed shot and you might be taking everyone on this
						ship down to the bottom of the ocean with you. Those rivets that keep this
						baby afloat can unzip like you wouldn't believe in the right situations
						leaving a hole in the side of this boat big enough to fit a house through.
						It's an old ship as well, and the rusted hull wouldn't stand the force of a
						9mm round. Personally I'd advise that you don't use it because I doubt
						anyone will be using one against you here."</p>
					<p>You realize the wisdom in his words, after all this guy has made it through
						his fare share of wars, border skirmishes, and ghost sightings to know how
						to hold his own. You take his words to heart and decide to keep the radio on
						you at all times. It has a fold out plug for recharging at night. The gun is
						definitely a very last weapon here. Much like on an airplane, a poorly
						placed round on could potentially doom the entire ship. Transportation in
						general is a poor place to stage a gun fight, you reckon.</p>

					<p>You tell Bernard that the painting is missing. He looks at you
						questioningly. "What painting," he asks. You tell him about the auction that
						you and Sarah went to earlier. It seems like an important point but you're
						not sure why. Why would Sarah take the painting out of the room? It was just
						a keepsake from the journey, nothing more (that you know of).</p>
					<p>Bernard grabs a cigarette and lights up. The smoke fills the room. He sits
						back and thinks for a second. "I know someone who might be able to help us.
						His name is Manny and he works down at the casino. He's in charge of much of
						the security on this ship. I was talking with him a couple of days ago and

			<!-- Impl - Mark (testsuite) -->
			<page id="pg_tellBernardAboutMarksPlans">
				<content>
					<p>The tone of the conversation you had with Mark keeps ringing in your head.
						You can hear his words over and over again as if unresolved deep in your
						mind, "The ship can finally rest."</p>
					<p>Such finality to his statement. You decide to talk with Bernard and tell him
						about your conversation with Mark.</p>
					<p>Mark confided in you and you realize that if he finds out... then you will
						discover the true nature of his character. Something tells you that you
						should be worried. Something tells you that if he finds out you should be
						very worried.</p>
					<p>You gingerly let out a few words about the conversation, then search
						Bernard's expression for feedback. You know that your friendship with
						Bernard might be at stake as well. You did after all talk with Mark without
						about sensitive subjects without Bernard's permission.</p>
					<p>You decide to take it slow and see how things play out. Bernard understands
						what you're saying, and he seems to understand why you're telling him. He's
						spent many years managing private investigators and has heard every
						double-cross in the book.</p>
					<p>At first he seems a bit surprised, but then a memory starts to take hold of
						him. He looks like he's been here before and is disturbed and disappointed;
						you can tell this without saying a word.</p>
					<p>"And then Bernard, then he said something that I disturbed me, 'The ship can
						finally rest.' What do you make of that?" you ask.</p>
					<p>Bernard stays silent for several seconds, thinking over what you've said. It
						seems somewhat obvious to you, but there's still quite a bit of room for
						interpretation. You wonder over and over again what he might plan to do to
						bring this statement to life. Bernard seems to be caught in the same cycle
						of thought, "What is going to happen here?" he seems to wonder. Bernard
						moves to the dresser. Opening the drawer he pulls out a device of some sort.
						Holding it up to you he says, "I didn't tell you this earlier because I was
						worried that I'd be leading us down the wrong path", he says. "This phone
						was taken off of a dead man in the ship docks of Cairo. The authorities
						didn't know what to do so they started looking through the phone for any
						clues. All of the numbers in the call log have been disconnected except for
						one... a direct line to this ship. This is one of the reasons we are here."
						Bernard hands you the phone. "They're worried because the number was unknown
						even to the phone system maintainers. Also, someone was on the other end of
						the line to pick it up... We've found several disturbing references to some
						sort of 'final plan' for this ship. The circumstances of the death are
						equally disturbing. It seems like something big might be going down here.
						Some sort of coordinated attack on the Queen Elizabeth II. I didn't mention
						this earlier because I didn't get a good feeling about the validity of the
						find. The password on the phone was disabled along with message encryption.
						It almost seems like the man carrying it wanted the information to be read."
						"We lifted contacts and text messages but unfortunately we weren't able to
						make much of it. The history of the text messages, however, contained
						somewhat lengthy and in-depth information about the structure of key
						operational equipment on the ship."</p>
					<p>Bernard moves back to his seat at the small table. He points his finger to
						his laptop screen where you see a map showing lines crisscrossing throughout
						the Mediterranean sea. "The phone calls were traced back to someone on this
						ship. We tracked them to various Internet addresses hosted from the on-board
						communication system. Manny has been helping me investigate, but at present
						we have been unable to track them down." As you hear more of the convoluted
						plot, you start to worry once again. Nervousness takes hold as your very
						safety is put into question. This is starting to seem much bigger than just
						Mark and Sarah. A person somehow related to this has been killed, and you
						wonder if you're putting yourself into grave danger as well. Sarah's missing
						and you wonder if it's because of something she knew or something she found
						out. Mark seemed a bit touchy as well.</p>
					<p>You instantly become much more cautious about the words that you use, even
						in the privacy of Bernard's cabin. You wonder how likely it is that
						Bernard's cabin is bugged? What words have you used while here? After all,
						it would explain some of your coincidental encounters with Mark. This
						project is blowing out of the water, and if you're correct then it's worth
						that kind of effort. Bernard senses your uneasiness and says "I found a bug
						here earlier. It's been disposed of. I think this room is clean." You ease
						up a bit. Changing the subject he says, "Manny can help us. Follow me." And,
						with that Bernard closes his laptop and you both head out into the hallway
						on a straight line for the casino.</p>
					<p>You make your way back to the "Money Cage" and wait in line with several
						other people. The metal bars remind you that those who lose money sometimes
						need a little reminder to keep themselves reasonable. "Hello?" the girl at
						the front counter says. "I need to speak to Manny," Bernard says, adding,
						"This is urgent." She says that she'll check in back, and walks through the
						door in the back of the cage. A moment later Manny appears. "Hello, may help
						you?" "Hi, I'd like to cash out." Bernard says handing his passenger card to
						Manny. You realize that Manny and Bernard are pretending that they've never
						met so you play along. Looking around, you notice that the entire casino is
						extremely well monitored with scores of cameras up and down the floor. Manny
						runs his passenger card through the reader, then hands it back to Bernard
						with a slip of paper to sign. Bernard signs it uneventfully and you both
						make your way out of the casino.</p>
					<p>Heading out of the casino, you and Bernard head down a little known access
						hallway bridging over the passenger area. The walls here are much less
						ornate than the passenger areas, but still nicely tended solid white with
						red trim. Shortly thereafter you see Manny approaching. "So what's this
						about, Bernard?" Manny asks with a tinge of confrontation in his voice.
						Whispering to Manny, Bernard says "Something has come up, something big. I'm
						starting to think that someone is trying to sink the QE2. We're in a bind
						here and need your help." Manny seems very wary. "We need to see the tapes
						of a passenger on this ship. We have a name and a room number. I don't think
						we have much time, maybe only a day. I don't think we'll make it to
						Constantinople." Bernard continues. Manny seems hesitant to bring the video
						footage into the conversation. He continues to pace back and forth, "If
						you're right then we have no problem but if you're wrong there will be a
						significant trail of information that I will have to make disappear. It's
						risky Bernard, and there's always the possibility that I'm not aware of
						everything about the security systems on the ship. I've been here quite a
						while, but that doesn't mean for sure." A long pause ensues. "The stakes are
						high though. Damn Bernard!". Bernard says "I have a team member still
						missing. It's very likely that she will be forgotten in the hectic chaos
						that ensues." Bernard says. "We need your help Manny." A blank uncomfortable
						pause ensues.</p>
					<p>Hesitantly, Manny starts slowly moving down the deck and through the doors
						separating the crew passageways of the ship from the passenger areas. After
						several minutes all three of you arrive at a stairway leading down what
						looks like two or three levels below. You're definitely off the beaten path
						at this point. You follow Manny down the stairway and onto the walkways with
						metal galvanized railings and crisscrossed metal floors that you recall
						seeing before in the engine room areas. As you approach a doorway, you
						notice a security card reader on the right side. Manny slides his card and
						you hear a click followed by the whoosh of the opening door. You follow
						Manny.</p>
					<p>Entering the room, you see stacks of monitors and hundreds of cables running
						from one location to another. Complex switchboards and machinery with
						glowing green and red LEDs light the room. You hear computer disks spinning
						and a large monitor dominates the center of the control room. Manny closes
						the door behind you, "This is it folks, this is the hub of the ship's
						security system. All communication and security data pass through here in
						one way,shape, or form." Manny moves up to the console. Tapping the keyword
						the monitor springs to life and prompts for a password. Manny enters his
						password and logs into the computer. You see a Linux desktop with icons
						strewn across the screen. To you, it looks like utter chaos but Manny seems
						to navigate with some sort of formula. "Okay Bernard, who are we talking
						about?" Bernard replies "His name is Mark Coleman and he is in cabin 572."
						Manny pushes a couple of buttons and brings up the passenger list. Looking
						down to room 572. "Bernard this is showing that cabin 572 is empty. Are you
						sure?" Bernard looks at you and you nod back, "Yes." "Okay then we need to
						make this a little more interesting."</p>
					<p>You're amazed at how fast he's able to cross-reference passenger rooms with
						photo IDs, purchase records of each passenger, room service records, and
						phone records. "Well, your right, there is someone there but I don't know
						who he is." Searching through the phone records makes a list of cabins that
						have been called from this cabin. "Mark has been busy, and he seems to be
						pretty good, at covering his tracks." Manny points to a record on the
						screen, "Right here he made a phone call to a room which 5 minutes later
						made a phone call to Egypt, but the interesting part is that the phone calls
						were exactly the same length. 37 seconds. Seems more than a little
						coincidental wouldn't you say? My guess is that he's using another room or
						possibly several rooms to automatically forward his messages. He seems to
						know that he's being tracked." Data flies on and off the screen while video
						footage is analyzed. A video of Mark is shown as he exits his room and looks
						directly into a camera down the hallway. "He knows there are cameras here,
						and it bothers him. Justifiably so because we've just started." Manny
						gloats.</p>
					<p>Manny takes the video clip now showing and drags it into another application
						which somehow makes reference points of Mark's face and motions. "Luckily
						for us, he seems to have a distinctive motion to his movements and he also
						has a somewhat distinctive jawline. His sunglasses won't help him evade the
						cameras. Now that I've run a video of him through the analyzer, we can start
						searching all of the ship's video records since we left Cairo." A progress
						bar shows in the middle of the screen: 15 min., 14 min.; you wait patiently
						and finally the operation is complete. "We have 25 reference videos that are
						highly likely to contain Mark. I'm guessing that there's no better time than
						the present to start looking through all of them. What was the exact time
						that Sarah disappeared?" Manny asks. You reply to Manny "It was 5 PM on the
						second night that I started to get worried about her being missing." You can
						feel the emotion welling up in you. If this could find Sarah! If Mark is
						somehow related to this we may actually be able to finally find her! A knot
						wells up in your chest.</p>
					<p>Manny scans the references looking for anything around that time, but
						nothing shows up. There is a space in the list from noon on day 2 until that
						night. "Well let's try to just start from the beginning and look to see what
						he's been up to." It's already been two hours, but you can think of nothing
						but continuing the search. "Who is Mark?" You can hear the question in
						everyone's mind. You continue looking through the videos in hopes of finding
						out more about this mysterious Mark character. "First off, let's find out
						who he really is." Manny zeros in on a early reference to camera 1525. "This
						is the camera out in front of a small supply shop on level 3. To buy
						anything and everything on this ship you must use your passenger card. All
						we need to do is cross reference his transactions with video footage. The
						footage is displayed on the monitor. You see that it is Mark. He's
						purchasing some shaving cream. Looking at the time indicator scrolling past
						on the tape you can see the exact instant that he hands his passenger card
						to the cashier, and the cashier swipes it. "That's it, let's figure out who
						this guy is," Manny says. He opens up another application and looks for that
						concession stand at that moment. A customer name pops up, "Alex Da Silva".</p>
					<p>"Of course this may not be his real name either," Manny says, "But at least
						it's the name he registered under for this trip. Being that he had to pass
						through Customs, at least we know that he has fake identification that can
						make it through the process," Manny says. "We have now tied his face to a
						passenger".</p>
					<p>Manny starts cycling through all of the videos quickly looking for more
						information about Mark a.k.a. "Alex". "This guy knows this ship. And he
						looks like he's up to no good," Manny says. "Look at the way he ducked into
						the crew area, he knows we don't have cameras down there, so it's a matter
						of trying to find out where he might be going and how long he might take to
						get there. Then, we'll have to guess where he might pop back into view."
						Manny reclines in his chair "Now where might he be going? He could be going
						up one level to the observation deck in which case he would trigger a couple
						of cameras going out to the deck, or he might be attempting to gain access
						to somewhere far deeper into the ship. Let's do a search."</p>
					<p>Manny starts typing terms on the screen in some complex search language. "We
						have roughly 3 possibilities. It looks like, assuming that he maintained his
						prior trajectory and velocity..." Manny zeros in one of the videos. "Why
						would he be heading by camera number 7525? That camera leads to some of the
						more secure areas of the ship I guess..." Manny's voice trails off. He then
						frantically starts looking up information on a particulate camera, camera
						number 5706. Using software he scans that camera for any movement in the
						past day or two. Nothing comes up. "Nothing, then." Manny says, "Maybe he's
						aware of this room, and maybe he came here." He begins to rub his chin again
						in deep concentration. "Maybe he's trying to wipe out the tapes!" Manny then
						clicks on the camera and presses a button to check timestamps. Sure enough,
						a gap shows up of four hours on the afternoon of day two, "He was here and
						he wiped the God damn tapes! I bet he wiped out the other tapes as well
						around the time of Sarah's disappearance."</p>
					<p>Manny jumps from his seat, opens the door, and runs out of the room to a
						dark corner of the hallway. He stands on the railing reaching for something.
						It looks a bit dangerous as a fall would heave him into the metal girders
						far below. Finally grabbing something, then pulling it down he brings a
						small box back into the room and shuts the door behind. "I put this out just
						in case something like this ever arose. It is an ultra-low powered camera.
						Anyone who walks into this room will trigger it and it will snap a photo."
						Manny plugs the camera into the computer and searches it for images on that
						day. He opens an image and you see a picture of Mark swiping a card over the
						card reader by the door. You all stand stunned. Manny is possibly the most
						stunned, "How could some no-name passenger have the highest level of
						security clearance on the ship?" "We're not done yet," Manny says, "These
						tapes are backed up at another location not far from here. Just in case
						something like this were ever to happen I put a plan together. Follow me."</p>
					<p>You follow Manny out of the room and down a couple more flights of stairs
						into what seems like a storage area filled with boxes. Off in the distance
						you see wires coming through the ceiling down into a corner of the storage
						area. As you move closer you can see that the wires run directly into a
						small box underneath a table. "I personally wired this up about 10 years
						ago. I don't think anyone else knows it's here." Manny opens the box.</p>
					<p>Inside you see a safe. Manny enters the pass-code and pulls the handle,
						opening the door. Flashing red lights show themselves in the safe. He
						removes one of the drives and closes the box again. All three of you then
						proceed back up to the security monitoring station. Manny plugs the drive's
						USB cable into the central computer. He then starts searching for the
						missing videos. "Everything looks good. We'll be back in business soon,"
						Manny says. "Processing will take about 10 min." The time passes at a
						snail's pace. The stress is almost unbearable, there's no time to waste but
						at every level there are issues of some sort. You pray that the videos will
						shed some light.</p>
					<p>Finally, the operation finishes and Manny goes straight to one of the videos
						that Mark must have deleted. You see a man pushing a clothes hamper down a
						hallway; it seems uneventful at first. "I'm guessing that Mark deleted this
						video for a good reason. A passenger should not be in that room, it should
						be empty," Manny says, examining the tape. You see something pop on the
						corner of the basket. "Wait!" you yell to Manny. "Rewind that," he does as
						you request. Bernard and Manny zoom in on the area you point to. It looks
						like a dent in the basket, but it seems rather organic in motion. "Sarah!"
						you yell. Manny replays the clip a couple more times. Each time it looks
						more an more like there may have been someone in the hamper. Feeling that
						time is running short you say "Look, we may not have much time. We have a
						room, we have a video showing what looks like a person. We need to go right
						now!" Bernard and Manny look a bit more skeptical but eventually all three
						of you head for the doorway.</p>
					<p>All of the clues point toward something significant about to happen here on
						the QE2. Bernard is right, if the ship goes down Sarah more than likely will
						be left behind. You make your way up to the cabin. As you walk by the room
						you notice something on the ground. It looks like a ring. You pick it up for
						a closer inspection, it looks like a cheap knock-off wedding ring. You
						examine it a bit closer and realize that you've seen this ring before. In
						fact it came in a matching set and you're wearing the other half of that
						set. This is Sarah's ring! You approach the door and can hear movement in
						the room.</p>
					<p>Knocking, you hear someone get up and walk toward the door. A large man
						opens the door. Your body moves before your brain knows what's happening,
						and you smash the man's nose with your fist as you push your way into the
						room. The thug drops cold-cocked to the floor. You start searching the cabin
						and rush into the restroom where you see Sarah in the bathtub with her hands
						and her feet bound. Her eyes open and she realizes that its you. Within a
						couple of seconds she is freed and you help her up out of the bathtub. Her
						hands and her feet are bruised and she stands heavily favoring one foot. "I
						knew you would come. I knew you would come, Travis." You can tell that she's
						exhausted. She puts her head on your shoulder leaning into you for support.</p>
					<p>You hear Bernard slowly make his way into the cabin. He approaches Sarah;
						"Sarah, it's you, it's really you." Bernard grabs Sarah and hugs her tight.
						"I thought we'd lost you for good. Thank God." Tears start to roll down his
						cheeks as he loses control. All three of you embrace each other in a group
						hug. Sarah has tears on her face and kisses you on the cheek. Words seem to
						fail you as you look into her tired and worn eyes. The moment is cut short
						as all of you get the sense that time is of the essence. You move back into
						the cabin living area.</p>
					<p>Manny is taking care of the man lying on the ground. He is face down and
						still unconscious. Seeing a dark brown circle developing around his eye you
						realize that you must've hit him dead on. Manny picks up the phone in the
						cabin and dials a number, "Yes, Detective Farse, we need your assistance
						immediately. The room number is 437. Please come at once." You switch your
						attention from Manny back to Sarah. Somehow, you just can't believe that you
						actually found her after these difficult days. The not knowing, the
						uncertainty of it all. You can feel your heart relax from the worry.</p>
					<p>Bernard moves Sarah over to the couch and starts talking to her about the
						abduction. You start to search the cabin to see if you can find more
						answers. The man on the floor seems to have no ID, not even a passenger card
						on his body. With the combined skills of Manning and Farse, you feel that
						this will not be an issue for long. They will figure out who he is and where
						he is from.</p>
					<p>Detective Farse walks into the room. He bends down to examine the man on the
						ground. "He's going to have a nasty black eye. We should have the medics
						looked at him before too long." "The missing woman that we've been looking
						for has been found," Manny tells Farse. Farse notices Sarah on the couch and
						starts to move in her direction; Manny grabs him on the shoulder. "Detective
						Farse, we have some very serious issues to discuss - right now." Manny
						guides Farse back into the hallway to talk talk over the situation.</p>
					<p>After several minutes the man on the floor begins to come back to
						consciousness. He is groggy and when he realizes that he is unable to move
						his arms he starts to panic. You help him up. "Hello Mr. Unknown, let me
						introduce you to a friend of mine who you seem to have kidnapped! I believe
						that the rest of your stay aboard the ship is going to be one of the worst
						experiences of your life." At this moment Manny and Farse come back into the
						room. You yank the unknown abductor to his feet, and you all follow Manny
						out of the room; you push the unknown abductor ahead of you, keeping a close
						eye to make sure he doesn't try to make a break for it.</p>
					<p>Farse leads the way down to the Security Office and into the back where
						there is a dark room used for interrogations. Manny leads the man into the
						room and then settles down into a chair across from him. Farse brings out a
						fingerprint kit and the paper. Farse says "Alright stranger, here is where
						we get to know you a bit better."</p>
					<p>A moment later, a medic walks through the entrance to the Security Room
						carrying an emergency box. He walks up to you, "Hello, I'm looking for
						Detective Farse." You tell the man to wait a second and you go back into the
						interrogation room to tell Farse that the medic has arrived. He tells you
						that he wants a full panel done and a full physical for Sarah. You deliver
						the message to the Medic. He sits down by Sarah who is laying on the couch.
						"Excuse me Miss, my name is Rinaldo and I am a medic. I'd like to perform a
						physical evaluation if that's okay." Sarah seems like this is the last thing
						that she could possibly deal with right now, but she forces herself to a
						sitting position while Rinaldo takes measurements for blood pressure,
						reflexes, and a blood sample. After about 15 minutes Rinaldo seems satisfied
						with Sarah's health and packs up his gear. Rinaldo gathers his equipment and
						proceeds to exit the room, "Can you tell Detective Farce that so far
						everything looks normal. I'll let him know how the bloods tests go." You nod
						your head and Rinaldo exits the room.</p>
					<p>You sit down beside Sarah and she begins talking. She tells you about the
						painful last couple of days. She says that the abductors didn't hurt her,
						but they didn't take care of her either. She rubs the bruises on her hands.
						She has burn marks around her wrists from where the ties were bound. In the
						background, you can hear rising voices from the interrogation room. Some of
						the sounds are coming from the unknown man, and the rest are coming from
						Manny and Detective Farse. You look down at your hand. The knuckles are
						swollen, it's difficult to close your fingers.</p>
					<p>Manny leaves the interrogation room and approaches you. "This guy says that
						he's just a babysitter. He wants to tell us everything he knows, because
						he's heard the rumors that the ship is going to sink and he doesn't want to
						be stuck in a cell when that happens." Manny moves over to a computer on the
						detective's desk and logs in. "Now let's check this guy out." Manny begins
						typing away using information that he just retrieved from the thug in the
						interrogation room. After several minutes he exults, "It appears that Mr.
						Unknown has a spotted background of mischief and minor offenses relating
						back to a small branch of the Russian Mafia. Now hopefully we can find out
						where Mark has been doing his recruiting."</p>
					<p>Bernard returns with a large box of food in his hands. You offer to make up
						a plate for Sarah and deliver it to her, as she reaches gratefully for her
						first decent food in days. Meanwhile, Manny walks over to Bernard. "We've
						found out who Mr. Unknown is and he says that he can help us find Mark. I'm
						not quite sure how to judge this though, but we don't have much time from
						the sounds of it." They walk out of the office discussing the situation.</p>
					<p>Sarah is completely exhausted now that she's finished her meal, but forces
						herself to stay awake, at least for a bit longer. She recounts what little
						she knows of the events from the past couple of days. "I was walking out of
						the room and suddenly I felt someone grab me. They injected something into
						my shoulder and I instantly went limp. Another man helped stuff me into a
						cart, and the next thing I know I'm tied up in the bathroom. That's really
						all I know." Not much to go on for sure; Sarah was obviously just a victim
						in this high-stakes game.</p>
					<p>Moments later, Farse walks out of the interrogation room escorting the
						prisoner. He takes the prisoner back into the holding cells off in the
						holding area. You can hear the large metal door slam. You hear a voice
						yelling, "Don't leave me here!! The ship is going down, I'll die in here."
						Farse closes a large door behind him, which muffles the prisoners' yells.</p>
					<p>Bernard and Manny join Sarah and Travis. Farse says "I'm glad that you're
						both back. We gathered quite a bit of information just now. I'm starting to
						believe the rumors that something just might happen here." He then
						continues, "We need to relay this information to the Ship's Captain. Anton
						needs to know about this. Someone needs to stay with the prisoner and with
						Sarah." Bernard raises his hand to volunteer for the job. "Great," Farce
						Says, "Travis and I will head up to talk with Anton in person. Bernard will
						stay here and monitor Sarah and the cell." Manny seems a bit anxious, "I
						have a plan to trap Mark. All I need is a couple of hours to get things
						ready." Farce replies "Sounds good, but remember that we don't have much
						time. We need to work together to pull this off." Manny then heads out of
						the room.</p>
					<p>Bernard takes a seat on a lounge chair beside Sarah. "If anything happens
						while I'm gone, Bernard here are the keys to the cells. The man in there is
						somewhat dangerous so I'll leave it up to you what to do if something
						actually does happen. Here's a set of handcuffs." Farse passes the cuffs to
						Bernard. With that you and Detective Farse exit the Security Room and head
						up to the ship's bridge to talk with Anton.</p>
					<p>Entering the bridge, the shiny chrome of the instruments is the first thing
						that catches your attention, the second is the lack of people actually on
						the bridge. You find it amazing that a ship as big as the Queen Elizabeth II
						only takes three people in the bridge to operate. A large gentleman sits in
						a plush chair overlooking the other two. You gather that this is the focus
						point for all commands given on the ship. Detective Farse approaches the
						man, "Captain Anton, we have to talk." Anton goads Detective Farse, "And
						what might we need to talk about, Detective?" He asks inquisitively, yet
						sternly. Farse takes a quick look around the room to see who is present. Two
						senior officers are manning banks of electronic equipment to make sure the
						ship is operating at maximum efficiently. "It's a rather sensitive matter.
						Can we speak in private?" Anton seems to be getting a little leery of the
						situation. "Sure, let's talk in the map room." He points to a room just to
						the back of the bridge.</p>
					<p>You walk into the map room. In the middle is a large table that doubles as a
						cabinet. In the cabinet are maps outlining the various parts of the world
						that the Queen Elizabeth II has navigated through. Rulers and protractors
						lay on the table. The walls are covered with maps of the world. Anton closes
						the door behind him. "Okay Detective Farce, we've done as you requested.
						What is this about?" You can sense the tension in the air. Anton and Farse
						have some sort of history together. They seem to tolerate each other, but
						not much more.</p>
					<p>"Captain, we have some somewhat verifiable information that we need to share
						with you. It is of the utmost urgency," Farse says. "Go on," Anton
						hesitantly acknowledges. "There are rumors of a plot on this journey, a plot
						so sinister it is almost unbelievable. I thought it was some randomly hyped
						up nonsense until just a couple of hours ago. There is a woman on the ship
						who went missing earlier in the journey..." Anton moves closer to Farse,
						"Yes, I heard about that. Have you found her?" He paces slowly. "Yes
						captain, we just found her. We apprehended her kidnapper as well."
						"Excellent," Anton says "A promotion is soon approaching I assume." "Well
						captain, there is a more urgent matter at hand. The rumor that we've heard
						is that someone was attempting to sink this ship. After interrogating the
						kidnapper I'm starting to worry that this in fact is no rumor." Farse
						expands, "Security Officer Manny Carero has narrowed down the search for a
						particular person who may be connected intimately with this eventuality."
						Anton seems to need more information and slightly waves Farse to continue.
						"From my interrogations it sounds like this is very far along. I think that
						everyone on board this ship could be in danger as we speak." Anton starts
						pacing slowly back and forth, looking Detective Farse directly in the eye as
						if trying to get a feel for the severity of this problem and at the same
						time personally frustrated with the whole conversation. "So, what exactly do
						you recommend?"</p>
					<p>It seems a rather litigious question, something you would use to establish
						blame when things go terribly wrong. Farse sees that this is in fact a
						difficult question to answer. On the one side if there were bombs and they
						were to explode, the ship could sink violently and kill everyone. On the
						other side it could sink slowly and give several hours for people to
						evacuate. In the first case no doubt people would die, but in the second
						case the evacuation of the passengers might might go fairly safely and
						orderly. The evacuation of a vessel such as the QE2 would cost millions.
						Right here, right now, after several decades of service in ship security,
						Detective Farse realizes that his job and his reputation are on the line.
						Measuring these options he replies, "It is difficult to make a judgment call
						on something as speculative as a random rumor, but we have evidence from
						several sources that something bigger is at work here which leads me to
						think that something has to be done. It seems to me that the evacuation, if
						it were to occur, would be an expensive operation, but the safety of our
						passengers is and always has been our number one priority. Not to mention
						the financial cost if, God forbid, the ship is sunk and people are injured
						or even killed. This vessel has a spotless record that spans many decades
						across much of the world. I personally feel that there is enough evidence to
						warrant an evacuation of the vessel." And with those words Chief Security
						Office Marcus Farse orders the evacuation of the Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
					<p>Antoin seems to be anticipating this response and has a reply ready to go,
						"Okay, Detective Farse I understand your points, and you are the acting
						security lead on this ship, but when you are called into the board room and
						stand in front of hundreds of extremely wealthy and powerful individuals,
						will you still have that conviction to stand by your decision?" Farse
						hesitates for a second imagining himself sitting in the boardroom telling
						the powers that be that he ordered the evacuation. "I would persevere" he
						replies. Anton senses the commitment in his voice and opens the map room
						door.</p>
					<p>Walking to Senior Officer Simkins he says, "A situation has arisen, it
						appears that this ship may be in very serious danger. We need to order the
						complete evacuation of this vessel minus a skeleton crew for engine
						operations." The officer seems stunned by the words, "I'm sorry Captain I
						just want to make sure that I heard you correctly. You're ordering a
						complete evacuation of the vessel?" Anton replies "Affirmative." Officer
						Simkins takes his orders and runs with them. Office Simkins looks over at
						officer Ford, "You heard the captain. Start the evacuation procedure."
						Officer Ford picks up the phone and starts to pass the word on, "This is not
						a drill. Let me say this again. This is most definitely not a drill." You
						hear these words over and over as the bridge officers spread the word to the
						various teams on the ship.</p>
					<p>Anton returns back to the map room and closes the door, "Detective Farse, we
						are still faced with a dilemma. Assuming the evacuation goes as planned in
						one hour's time we should be down to a skeleton crew. Just enough people to
						man the vessel." Anton moves us toward a map and points down to a small
						harbor off the coast of Turkey, "The coast of Turkey is studded with a sharp
						and rocky coastline. The only feasible place to set the ship down might be
						in the southwest territory. Gullok would be an ideal harbor, if we can make
						it." Pointing to the large map on the table you can see how the elevation
						lines seem to level out around the harbor. "It has a nice shallow and flat
						area for us to ground the ship, and it's big enough to handle a vessel the
						size of the QE2. Other than that, we have few options. If we plan this
						correctly and we have a bit of luck we should be able to prevent this ship
						from being lost. Gullok isn't more than 50 feet deep."</p>
					<p>Officer Simkins knocks on the map room door, "The word is out, Captain."
						"Excellent. After the evacuation is complete set a course for Gullok." Anton
						says. "Gullok?" Officer Simkins says in astonishment as he moves toward the
						map. Anton is pointing toward the harbor. "There's no way that we could get
						her into there!" "You would be correct in a normal set of circumstances, but
						right now we need to think of saving this vessel in the eventuality that it
						sinks. If we dock the vessel right here, then there should be only about 30
						feet between the hull of the ship and the soft bed of shale underneath. If
						she does sink she will be recoverable." Anton answers looking around the
						room at the concerned eyes. "Does anybody have a better idea?" he asks.
						Understanding the logic behind his argument no one can think of a better
						plan. The room falls silent. "Okay then the plan is set. Lets evacuate the
						passengers and all nonessential crew members as quickly as possible. Then we
						begin our journey to Gullok. Officer Simpkins, are the ships on their way?"
						Anton asks. "Yes Captain, there are three vessels in the vicinity that will
						be arriving shortly. It sounds like we'll have more than enough room for the
						passengers." Officer Simkins replies. "Wonderful, remember that our priority
						here is the passengers. As much as I care for this ship, she will have to
						come second," Anton states.</p>
					<p>Everyone exits the map room. The calls start coming into the bridge
						verifying the order. The bridge crew seems to be constantly in motion. You
						and Farse take this opportunity to start making your way out of the bridge.
						As you stand in the doorway Anton motions to you. Pausing his phone call he
						says, "Thank you Detective Farse for working diligently on this
						investigation. Time will tell if your hunch is correct, but the facts stand
						by them self." With that, you and Detective Farse exit the bridge.</p>
					<p>On the way back to the Security Room the ship's sirens activate. The noise
						blares up and down the hallways. Then you hear a voice on the announcement
						system, "All passengers, the ship is being evacuated. This is not a drill,
						repeat this is not a drill. Please gather your essential belongings and move
						toward your designated evacuation areas." The message repeats itself over
						and over again. Crew members start moving quickly up and down the hallways
						knocking on doors. Passengers come out of their rooms into the hallway with
						confused looks, searching for guidance. Other passengers seem to understand
						the message quite clearly and enter the hallway with all of their luggage
						ready to go, making a quick escape ahead of the majority. As you walk past
						the lobby area you can see that all of the elevator lines already wrap up
						and down the hallways on each level. You and Farce decide to split up as he
						has important matters to attend to with the prisoner. You feel obligated to
						help out the passengers so you head down to the lifeboat closest to your
						cabin and start helping people board the boats.</p>
					<p>Hundreds of people stand in a orderly lines with their things waiting to
						board the lifeboats. The crew is quickly yet safely working to board all the
						luggage and passengers safely. Worried about space a new rule is shouted
						from crew member to crew member down the deck: "Only one bag allowed."
						Passengers are forced to decide what to keep and what to leave. Abandoned
						luggage is heaved into large piles at various spots on the deck. Off in the
						distance you can make out a ship approaching the QE2. As it gets closer you
						realize that it is a freighter of some sort, with hundreds of large metal
						containers neatly stacked on it's main deck; the kind of containers that you
						usually see attached to big trucks cruising down the freeway.</p>
					<p>Finally, after a couple of hours, you board the last passenger and their
						belongings into the lifeboat. It's a strange sight to see boat after boat
						after boat being lowered to the water in unison. Many of the boats are
						already in the water and clustered a safe distance away from the ship. Some
						of the boats start moving towards the freighter that just pulled up. After
						the last passenger has been boarded you decide to head back to the security
						room to check on Sarah.</p>
					<p>On arriving you sense a frantic energy in the air. Sarah rushes toward you,
						"Travis," she says, "They've found Mark! He's in the interrogation room
						right now. I was looking through the two-way mirror and heard him say that
						we only have an hour until the explosions are triggered!" Manny heads out of
						the interrogation room, "Oh, you're back Travis," he says. "Mark has
						confirmed our suspicions. He says we only have one hour until the bombs
						explode. We don't have much time, so we need to work together. Mark refuses
						to tell us where the bombs are planted. Considering that we don't have
						enough time to disarm them it really doesn't matter anyways. I'll inform the
						captain." As you moves toward the phone you grab his attention, "Were you
						able to find out who Mark is connected with on the ship? How did he have the
						pass card?" Manny replies "Those kind of questions can be looked into later,
						for now we need to concentrate on saving the ship." Manny then moves to the
						phone and dials the direct line to the bridge. "Yes Captain Anton, we have
						some additional news for you." And with that he tells the captain of the
						situation.</p>
					<p>Sarah moves closer to you, "I'm so worried Travis." She hugs you for
						support. "Things sound so bad right now." "Sarah, the captain has a plan.
						We're going to ground the ship in a harbor not far away from here. The only
						problem is that I don't know if he has enough time to get us there before
						the bombs explode. He's planning to take the ship into the harbor. When the
						bombs go off the ship will wedge into the soft sands below. They can save
						the ship, Sarah."</p>
					<p>Manny hangs up the phone and moves over to you, "The captain says we still
						have enough time to make it to Gullok, but we need to move quickly. If they
						put the pedal to the metal we just might make it." You feel the ship
						starting to move forward again, gaining momentum quickly. You and Sarah go
						out to the deck near the Security Room and watch as the lifeboats and the
						rescue ships move off and disappear into the horizon. Looking towards the
						back of the ship you see large waves start to emerge from the ship's wake.
						The ship is gaining speed quickly and you have a feeling that you're in for
						a ride that has not been witnessed since the Great War, World War II. Now
						you will truly find out how fast the QE2 can move. You recall that the ship
						was originally designed with a dual purpose, for peacetime and for war. It
						has been over six decades since it last was put to the test.</p>
					<p>Over the intercom a voice takes shape. In a low, foreshadowing tone Captain
						Anton says, "Dear remaining crew, you have performed admirably in our time
						of need. The passengers are safe. Now, it is time that we try to save this
						ship. We are on a straight line for a small harbor on the west coast of
						Turkey, but the timing is such that we are being forced to test the ship's
						limits. I won't hide the details from you, there may be a bomb onboard. And
						from our intel, it is set to blow in less than an hour from now. Be prepared
						for this eventuality and God willing we will depart the ship in Gullok,
						putting it just over the soft sands of the harbor bed. This is probably more
						than you need or want to know, but if our plans do not work out as we hope,
						and if we do not make it to the harbor, I want you all to make every effort
						to try and save yourselves. This ship has seen it's day, there is no need to
						follow her to the bottom. This is a dangerous task but we will succeed with
						a little help and a little luck." You then hear a bit of static over the
						intercom and it goes quiet.</p>
					<p>The skeleton crew that remains on the ship now knows the secret, and
						understand in no uncertain terms the delicate balance of their future. The
						wake of the ship becomes even larger as the sun sets over the horizon.</p>
					<p>Thirty minutes later. Nighttime has taken hold. You notice the ship starts
						to abruptly decelerate as you see the harbor loom on the horizon. You can
						scarcely believe that an ocean liner of this size can travel that quickly in
						the open ocean. You hear Anton's voice come over the intercom, "We are
						quickly approaching Gullok where' we'll run the ship in a cove off to the
						right. It is a very flat piece of land. From there, you should depart
						hastily using whatever means you prefer. There are still several lifeboats
						available which might be the ideal way to go. The next time you hear me on
						the intercom it will probably be the last notice that it is time to leave,
						so be prepared."</p>
					<p>Just as Anton instructed, the ship slowly makes its way into the harbor and
						back to a calm cove off to the right. You almost think that the captain is
						navigating this huge ship onto the beach. Then it abruptly stops and you
						hear the anchor being released. Anton comes back onto the intercom, "This is
						it, time to depart everyone. We estimate that you have 10 minutes before the
						explosions will be triggered. Repeat, IT IS TIME TO EXIT THE SHIP! Make sure
						everyone is accounted for. Don't leave anyone behind. Best of luck to you
						all. Over."</p>
					<p>You and Sarah start to board the first lifeboat. Manny files the prisoners
						(handcuffed and chained) into the second remaining lifeboat with Bernard.
						Entering the boats is fairly uneventful and both boats lower to the water.
						You see a couple of other lifeboats being lowered to the water as well. Once
						in the water you remove the hoist lines, start the motor, and the boats move
						together off to a safe landing in the cove.</p>
					<p>Captain Anton and his chief officers are there, as well as several other
						crew members setting up a makeshift camp and putting together a fire.
						Officer Simkins is taking count, "We're all accounted for. That last boat
						looks like it has the last four." Suddenly, off in the distance, you see a
						flash of light followed by a loud thunder. The shockwave from the explosion
						underneath the water line creates a wave that is quickly dissipated
						throughout the cove and ends with the crash of a wave 10 feet tall on the
						surrounding beaches. You then see a second explosion breach the hull of the
						ship and large amount of water rush into the fissure. The ship starts
						twisting but is stopped after hitting the soft sands underneath. Anton's
						plan is a success and the QE2 comes to a rest leaning heavily to one side,
						but still upright. Over the hills you hear pulsating sounds. Helicopters
						with spotlights come over the hillside. The fire is a dead giveaway and they
						find you quickly. With the smoking ship in the background and spotlights
						focused on your group Anton says over the noise of the helicopters, "My
						fellows, this is how heroes are made. You will all be recognized as such."
						Several smaller vessels move into the cove and take charge of the scene.</p>
					<p>The night is followed by intense rounds of questioning, but finally the
						questions stop and you are let go finally by the Turkish police. They escort
						you to a hotel down the street. After a shower, you make your way into bed
						and hear a knock on the door. Opening the door you see Sarah, "You mind if I
						stay here tonight?". You fall asleep holding Sarah in your arms.</p>
					<p>Inquiries into the events leading up to the explosions on the QE2 start
						almost as soon as the headlines on the news papers are printed. All of the
						members of the skeleton crew who piloted the ship into the harbor at Gullok
						were requested to be present. The next morning you receive a letter
						postmarked from Britain by the "Parliamentary Regent's Office" requesting
						your presence in London within the next two days. With that you, Bernard,
						and Sarah pack up what belongings you have and head to the airport to catch
						the next available flight into London.</p>
					<p>At the inquiry hundreds of people stand outside the Parliamentary building
						watching as individuals exit dark limousines as they pull up to the front
						steps. As you three arrive, pass through security, and make you way into the
						proceedings you see Anton front and center speaking to the Council. He seems
						completely stressed out and argues his decisions to what seems like 50
						judges ready to cast a verdict on his future. You hear your name come up
						during the proceedings and an involuntary muscle twitch spasms through your
						shoulder. The stress of the whole event is immense.</p>
					<p>Later on that day you Bernard and Sarah take the stand. The questions are
						pretty dry but the main issue at hand seems to be whether you were
						affiliated with the rogue organization that planned this attack. Fortunately
						your employer (Central) has managed to procure a top-notch lawyer for this
						event, and he is able to coach you on the fly as to what should be said and
						how it should be said while testifying to the British Parliament. The
						proceedings are immensely steep in historical precedence, so unlike any
						proceeding that you've witnessed in the United States.</p>
					<p>After the inquest the media still isn't quite done with you. Two reporters
						in particular approach you as you leave the building. "We heard that the
						ghosts aboard the QE2 were to blame for this calamity, is that true?" The
						question is vague and your lawyer strongly advises against answering so you
						move on. So with that, all three of you head straight for the airport and
						back to the United States.</p>
					<p>Weeks later you hear that the investigation into Mark has gained momentum.
						The London police have got him singing like a bird. Names are flying out,
						one of which being a very rich, powerful, and relevant man, Jonas Davenport.
						Jonas is the chairman of the board of Petropole, and also part owner of the
						holding company which has ownership to the Queen Elizabeth II. As soon as
						the word gets out that Mr. Davenport has been implicated in the tragic
						events on the QE2, Petropole's stock nosedives on the London exchange.</p>
					<p>Later still, you find out that Jonas has been removed as the chairman of the
						board of Petropole, a position held by a member of the Davenport family for
						the last 43 years. He is now facing some very serious charges of criminal
						misconduct for his potential connection to the explosions that could have
						potentially killed many of the passengers and crew aboard the ship.</p>
					<p>Several months go by and you receive an e-mail from Bernard. In it he
						mentions that although things did turn out for the best, the day-to-day
						uncertainty of private investigation work has finally taken its toll on him.
						He's decided to retire from the investigation business and has just signed
						the title paperwork on a cozy little house overlooking the coniferous trees
						of a Virginia forest. He says that he's looking forward to starting a new
						adventure in his life, one that includes a lot of reflection on the things
						he has witnessed in his life.</p>
					<p>Detective Farse and security officer Manny Carrero are celebrated as heroes.
						Their quick thinking and decisive action lead to saving countless
						passengers, crew members, and the ship itself. Both men stated for the
						record that they long to return to their posts aboard the greatest ocean
						liner that has ever sailed the seas.</p>
					<p>The QE2 is patched up in no time and towed to a dry-dock in Ireland to be
						completely repaired. 14 months pass by and she is ready to be returned to
						the waters that she has sailed for the last 70 years. In addition to any
						necessary fixes, all of the news coverage of the ship has reminded people of
						the importance of this historical relic. Attendance had been low prior to
						the attempted sinking of the vessel. Much larger but less mobile modern
						cruise liners had been eating away at her profits for years. With the
						renewed excitement following the media coverage of the QE2, the ship has
						been retrofitted to bring it into competition with the dazzling luxuries of
						the newer ships.</p>
					<p>As for you and Sarah, you both decide to take a break from the always
						unknown world of private investigation and focus on living a simpler life.
						After a couple of years, you decide to become husband and wife, and within a
						couple more years you have two boys to pass on your stories about the
						mysteries of the QE2 onto.</p>
					<p>The ghost you ask... Well the reports seem to have subsided since you were
						called into investigate, but it seems like the ship is up to its same old
						tricks. "Delusional passengers have been conjuring up stories again." is how
						one magazine phrased it. Ironically, another rumor has reported that some of
						the occurrences have yielded information that officials have actually used
						during the investigations of Mark and Jonas.</p>
					<p>All in all, your memories of the ship fade over time and you find yourself
						focusing on the life that you and Sarah have created. You still think back
						to the bizarre events that you experienced while on the ship and somehow you
						feel honored to have been brought in to have been confided in by the ghosts
						of the ship. Some of the times you wonder if it was all a dream. But, in a
						world that seems to get more surreal by the moment who really knows for
						sure?</p>

					<p>You recall the message you received telling about a man named Mark on the
						ship who might be able to help you out. Bernard sets you straight by letting
						you know that, in fact, you both are working for Mark people right now
						(albeit a bit indirectly).</p>
					<p>You tell Bernard that either way Sarah is missing and maybe this Mark guy
						might be connected enough on this ship to help find her. Bernard agrees and
						asks you to get in touch with Mark..</p>

				<content>
					<p>"Well then, can I see it." he asks.</p>
					<p>You pull the plaque out of your pocket checking quickly to verify that it is
						in fact how you remembered it. Handing the plaque to Bernard you feel a
						little odd for a second as if your not quite sure what this will lead to.</p>
					<p>A slight queasiness grips your stomach. "Go figure," he says turning it over
						in his hands. "Well it definitely doesn't look like it's 80 years old, but
						then again it does look like it could have been manufactured around that
						time period." Looking closer he notices the wear marks around the bolt
						holes. "Definitely been used too." He points to the slight curve of the
						plate. Using his hands he makes a gesture to how big the tube must be that
						this plaque was placed on.</p>
					<p>"I believe you, I think this is something from another world, but how do we
						find out where it belongs?" He asks and walks to the sliding glass doors of
						the balcony. Looking out to the shoreline he seems to be frozen there for a
						couple of minutes as if remembering something. You sit and wait while he
						works things out in his head.</p>
					<p>"I never told you this but I lost someone that worked for me before." he
						says. "Sarah is not the first person that I've lost. Over time it's possible
						that these things happen I guess, but still it's a horrible feeling to go
						through. If we don't find her my life will never be the same. Even if we
						find her, I'm wrapping up this part of my life up for good."</p>
					<p>Bernard moves back to his chair facing outward toward the ocean. "PI work is
						great when it's good, but it's dangerous work. For a long time I thought
						that it was my fault somehow, but over the years I've realized that it
						wasn't a fluke. People in this line of business seem to disappear all the
						time." He looks over to you "I don't think this is for me anymore, I'm
						getting too old for the wear and tear of this job. I feel old now, and it's
						time for me to settle down a bit."</p>
					<p>"After this is done. It's all yours Travis." Bernard says. "You know close
						to as much as I know, and I'm handing the reigns to you. A person can only
						have so many memories in their head, and when all those memories start to
						chew you up from the inside, then it's time to move on. It is time for me to
						move on Travis."</p>
					<p>He moves over to the desk and picks up his satellite phone. Placing a call
						he says "Manny, we have another situation. Can you help again?" the words
						are difficult out of his mouth. You can tell that Manny said something back.
						Bernard replies "Ya Manny, ya one more favor for an old friend."</p>
					<p>Bernard continues, "There's a plaque that Travis found. We think it's an
						important clue. It says 'Torque Release Valve 3'. You have any idea where
						that might go?" You hear a voice coming from the phone but can't make out
						anything clear. Bernard nods "Got it. Well, we'll be here and waiting." Then
						Bernard hangs up the phone.</p>
					<p>"Manny thinks he knows the people to ask. He says he'll call back soon. I
						can just meet you at your room as soon as I find out. Be there! Go grab a
						bite to eat if you need something first though, this may last a awhile." You
						leave the room and take Bernard's advice by grabbing some food. The dinning
						areas on the ship are pretty amazing, but you decide to stick to the lesser
						known spots preferring to stay out of the main areas.</p>
					<p>Returning back to your cabin you start reviewing your notes on the trip.
						You've written several names on small pieces of paper and placed them on
						your cabin table in an effort to try and make sense of the last several
						days. Still nothing pops to mind, another waste of time.</p>
					<p>Their's a knock at the door. Opening the door you let Bernard and Manny into
						the room. Manny appears a bit nervous but seems to be trying hard to hide
						it. "Hello Mr. Neff." he says. You reply back likewise.</p>
					<p>Manny says "OK, here's the deal, 'Torque Release Valve 3' is located far
						down in the main shaft area of the ship. It's not easy to get down there.
						There are a lot of ladders and small passageways that you have to navigate
						to make it there. But, with that said, we can do it. We just have to be a
						bit careful. I warn you, it's hot, like very hot, down there. And there are
						moving parts so don't touch anything, and stay on the gangplank. OK?"</p>
					<p>You nod of course. "Lets do this now, and not wait around wondering about
						it." Manny says. "I don't have a whole lot of time right now, so it works
						best to get this started and wrapped up in a couple of hours. I'll get my
						things together and we can meet down by the aft elevators. I'll be on the
						ground floor next to the engine room entrance."</p>
					<p>You all agree and he leaves the room. You grab your flashlight, EMF
						detector, and several other smaller items that might come in handy. You and
						Bernard make your way down to the aft elevators.</p>
					<p>As you both approach the meeting point you look up and see another elevator
						coming down. You're surprised at how silent the elevators are here. Through
						the glass you see Manny coming down. He steps out of the elevator and over
						to the engine room door across the hallway. Opening the door you all step
						into the engine room area and start moving down the long flights of stairs
						leading to the bottom of the ship.</p>
					<p>Manny seems horribly out of place with his white suit. Bernard notices as
						well and makes a gaffe to Manny about it. Manny laughs a bit then replies "I
						got plenty of these outfits, twenty years of these outfits to be exact.
						Besides you'd be surprised what bleach can do."</p>
					<p>After descending several ladders the space gets more cramped and hotter. You
						hear moving machinery around the corner. A loud whipping sound like
						something very heavy turning very fast. A slight breeze is coming from
						around the corner. Flood lights alert you to a long spinning shaft which you
						obviously determine to be the propeller shaft of the ship. It is encased in
						a metal grated cover with small metal labels placed every 20 feet or so.</p>
					<p>You see plaques for "Torque Release Valve 5", "Torque Release Valve 4", then
						finally the metal plate for "Torque Release Valve 3" catches your attention.
						You place the plaque you have up against the new metal plate. The curved
						back of the plaque matches the form of the grated cover of the propeller
						shaft perfectly.</p>
					<p>"This is it" you say as loud as you can, motioning to Bernard and Manny. The
						heat is immense. Bernard's forehead is dripping with sweat. Suddenly you see
						a blue flame run down the length of the shaft. "Can you see that" you ask
						the others, but they don't seem to understand what you're saying. "I see a
						line of blue flames running down the propeller shaft, can you see it as
						well?" Manny looks to Bernard questioningly. Bernard answers "No we can't
						Travis, do you think it wants us to follow it?" You nod and start moving
						down the shaft.</p>
					<p>The flame keeps ahead of you both for awhile then stops and takes a left
						turn into a small side hatch. You move into the hatch and the flames
						highlight an area of the the hatch completely darkened.</p>
					<p>You see a light of some sort, a small red light blinking. Moving your
						flashlight over the red blinking light you feel shock immediately start to
						grip you as you see an LED countdown timer linked by wires to large wooden
						boxes.</p>
					<p>"This is a bomb!" you yell out to Bernard and Manny. You then backpedal
						rushing out of the hatchway as fast as you can. Bernard catches you and
						brings you back to your senses. "We're all here Travis." Bernard says. "It's
						ok, calm down! What did you see in there?" You point to the hatchway and
						mutter "b oomb!"</p>
					<p>Bernard sets you down to the ground and moves into the hatchway quickly
						coming out. Manny follows next then moves back out of the hatchway very
						slowly, very confused. "I can't tell what the timing marks mean. We need to
						get this news to the captain now!" All three of you start moving down the
						shaft corridor. "If that thing blows it will flood four or five water tight
						chambers. The ship will be doomed. Whomever put it there knew what they were
						doing." Manny says.</p>
					<p>Rushing up the ladders and through the engine areas you work your way back
						to the engine room entrance.</p>
					<p>"Should we get Farse on this?" you ask. Manny looks back to you and stops
						abruptly. "For now don't tell Farse, anything, at all! Nothing! For all we
						know he's in on this. I've had a couple of run-ins with him over the years.
						Lets just say that he tries to do the right thing, but he doesn't have a
						whole lot of leeway to do the right thing much of the time. He's on the spot
						all the time so he needs to act the part which isn't always the best thing
						for everyone."</p>
					<p>"We need to move up the chain, even past the captain of the ship." Manny
						says "Ian is the man to see. He can sort this out faster than anyone. Ian's
						the acting CEO for TransAtlantic Transports, the company that now owns this
						ship. I know where he probably is. Follow me." You're exhausted at this
						point but adrenaline keeps pushing you on.</p>
					<p>The emotional roller coaster of the last 15 minutes has been intense, but
						fortunately Manny thinks he can make a direct contact with the person who
						can matter the most in this moment. You all move up the ship, sometimes by
						ladder, sometimes by stairway, sometimes by elevator. Making your way to the
						top of this beast like climbing a mountain. Manny knows the way like the
						back of his hand.</p>
					<p>Finally you stop to look up to the bridge area. "Ian's suite is right past
						the bridge and a bit farther back." He points with his finger. Making your
						way up there you're stopped by a set of glass doors. Manny moves over to the
						card panel beside the door and swipes his card. The doors fly open and you
						move through into an amazing detailed area of the ship with the fanciest
						tapestries and antiques.</p>
					<p>Every thirty feet or so you see large images of the ship in various stages
						of being built. People shaking hands at the launching. Welders welding the
						hull together in dry dock. Images of groups of people standing for a
						portrait with blueprints hanging in the background. Images of royalty from
						around the world.</p>
					<p>Making your way to the elevator in the back of the hallway you're once again
						stopped by a glass door. Manny takes his ID card out and swipes it at the
						card reader. This time it doesn't seem to work and an LCD screen lights up.
						"Hello there, may I help you?" the voice says questioningly.</p>
					<p>Manny speaks into the camera. "There is a very urgent matter on this ship
						and we need to talk with you right now. This can not wait. This ship is in
						danger!" A couple of seconds later the glass doors blocking access to the
						elevator opens and the voice says "Come in then." somewhat casually. You all
						three move into the elevator and it begins to move up to the next floor.</p>

						the portal had closed while I was in there... It was just too risky."

				<content>
					<p>Bernard starts talking to you about some information he uncovered
						investigating the history of the Queen Elizabeth II. "When the Cunard
						company commissioned the ship..." he continues.</p>
					<p>The urgency of what you experienced at the ghostly costume ball jumps back
						into your mind. You cut off Bernard with an urgent haste, feeling it
						essential to share this information with him. "Bernard!" you say with an
						authoritatively tone.</p>
					<p>He stops his diatribe and lets you take the stage. You answer back "You'll
						never believe what I found!".</p>
					<p>"Oh really... I can believe quite a bit, you of all people should know that.
						What do you have?"</p>
					<p>You explain to him in detail how you were walking down the hallway when you
						saw the ghost. You followed the ghost breaking into doorway leading to the
						flight of stairs. You followed the ghost down to the conference area.</p>
					<p>Opening the door you were dumbstruck by an unbelievable scene. The ghostly
						costume ball! Hundreds of specters celebrating a reunion of sorts, many of
						which in strange costumes. "I thought about turning around but Sarah is
						gone. I pushed, through my own barrier, against my better judgment and into
						the room. The ghosts didn't really seem to notice me but at the same time
						they seemed to be aware that I was their. They moved out of my way seldom
						making eye contact."</p>
					<p>You continue the story talking about the costumes. You speak of Madeline the
						ghostly queen dressed as Queen Victoria. "Bernard, the ghosts are coming
						back to this ship. Something is making them return to repent their sins in
						life. This is what Madeline told me."</p>
					<p>You continue describing how she introduced you to the magician Maxwell. How
						Maxwell took you into his other dimensional study.</p>
					<p>Finally you get to the most important part and vividly outline to Bernard
						the contraption on the desk, the portal projector. "Maxwell somehow devised
						a projector that can create a portal into another universe, into the realm
						of ghostly inhabitance."</p>
					<p>Knowing that the whole story seems almost too much you pause for a second to
						gauge Bernard's reaction. In a tone a bit like a shrink asking his patient
						to continue he asks "Then, what did you do?". Bernard features are
						unreadable like a card shark waiting for the hand to play out. You get the
						feeling that he does believe you, and that he realizes that this was no
						dream at all.</p>

				<content>
					<p>"Yes it did." you tell Bernard. "I don't have it at the moment though."</p>
					<p>"Where is it then?" Bernard asks.</p>
					<p>"I took it to Mark to look over. He said he'll check into it." You say.</p>
					<p>Bernard gives you a questioning look. "Why exactly did you take it to Mark
						again?" he asks.</p>
					<p>"Well I thought Mark might be able to find out where it belongs. I get the
						feeling that he knows this ship pretty well." You realize that the words
						coming out of your mouth sound a bit naive.</p>
					<p>Bernard gives you a disappointed look. "You know Travis we've know each
						other quite awhile. You should have brought something like this to me first.
						Without the plaque itself it's going to be hard to convince anyone that
						there is some merit to your story. I'm hesitant to approach Manny about this
						unless I can show him the plaque."</p>
					<p>"Lets just go up to Marks room and get it back then." you reply. Bernard
						says "alright then." and you both take a stroll up to Mark's room. You knock
						on the door, and hear some movement in the room, but nobody answers the
						door. You knock again, and still no answer.</p>
					<p>You look over at Bernard a little embarrassed by the situation. "He must be
						out for a bit, lets try back later."</p>
					<p>"I don't know about you Travis, but I heard something move around in there.
						Bernard takes his fist and slams it into the door. "I hear you in there.
						Open this door!" Still nothing...</p>
					<p>Bernard signals that it's time to learn with a head motion. On the way back
						to Bernard's cabin he says, "I think you're plaque is long gone, and so is
						that lead." You both stroll back to the room in disappointment.</p>
					<p>"I just can't take your story to Manny. There's nothing to show for it, and
						I'm probably the only person here who would even come close to believing
						your story about the portal. Lets move on." Bernard says and you drop the
						conversation on 'Torque Release Valve 3' for now.</p>

					<p>You look directly at Bernard "Sarah. We need to find her. I went through the
						portal." you say decisively.</p>
					<p>Bernard moves back, you get the feeling that he's becoming a bit hesitant to
						continue. But you both realize in that instant that you must stick together
						at least for the remainder of the trip.</p>
					<p>"Lets backtrack a bit here." He says "How do you feel?".</p>
					<p>"Fine I guess. I don't feel any different, I don't think I am anyways." You
						continue telling him about the plants, how they grew at incredible speed,
						yet the moon never moved. The hooded character down by the fire that gave
						you the plaque with its skeletal arm. How the fire made shapes and seemed to
						talk to you in a strange language of symbols.</p>
					<p>Seeing Sarah in the rocking chair and finally seeing the cabin door with the
						beating red light in front of it. "I couldn't help but think that it was
						trying to tell me that Sarah is still here, and that she's still alive."</p>
					<p>Bernard slows things down again and asks you a question "You mentioned
						something that was given to you. When you passed back through the portal did
						it make it back through with you?"</p>
					<p>"Yes, it did." you answer to Bernard.</p>

					<p>You continue "I decided to jump into the bidding to see if my suspicions
						were correct. Did this guy really care what he was bidding on. The bidding
						was lingering at $32,000 when I put in a bid for $37,000. He was astonished
						that I would do such a thing, I could see it on his face. The auctioneer was
						a bit surprised as well especially because it's a Rudolphe Thornsden
						painting which doesn't usually make it to that level. He said 'Going once,
						going twice,' and I thought I had just purchased a horribly expensive
						painting unintentionally. Then Mr. Asiago jumped back in with $40,000."</p>
					<p>"I didn't want to get stuck with the bill for $40,000, but I wanted to see
						how high he would take this. I put in a clean $50,000, which got a set of
						devil eyes pointed right at me again from Asiago. He was pissed to say the
						least, but went ahead and called my bluff with a bid of $60,000. $60,000 for
						a Rudolphe Thornsden painting would make it double the highest priced
						painting he ever sold. At that point I decided to hold my tongue," you say.
						Bernard seemed to understand your reasoning but seemed a little concerned
						about your lack of caring about the fact that someone payed an additional
						$20,000 for a painting because of you.</p>
					<p>"Sarah is missing Bernard, and we don't have many leads. We need to start
						cracking some eggs here or we're going to leave this ship with nothing to
						help us find her," he slowly almost reluctantly seems to agree.</p>

					<p>"You know Bernard that Auction House seems to be a topic that has come up
						more than once. That Asiago character, he seemed like someone just playing a
						roll. I didn't get the feeling that he cared about the art at all. I think
						he was a buyer, and possibly only a buyer, put up to the task of purchasing
						the painting. He wasn't alone either which makes me wonder why they needed
						more than one person there. I think they wanted more than one witness
						because purchasing that painting, for some reason, was important."</p>
					<p>"So what should we do about it?" Bernard asks.</p>
					<p>You reply, "I don't know who Mr. Asiago is and I imagine that is not his
						real name. I don't think the background check will turn up anything. But, I
						do know where to find his name. He had to use something to buy the painting,
						a check, or a routing number, or a room number, something!"</p>
					<p>You continue "When Sarah and I purchased the painting I noticed that they
						keep a standard receipt book. I even saw them take it into the back room. I
						think that receipt book has the answers we need."</p>
					<p>"So are you suggesting that we break in and steal the book?" Bernard asks.</p>
					<p>You reply "Well, not steal the book, just copy some of it,".</p>
					<p>"You know Travis, this could get us into a world of trouble if we're caught.
						You know as well as I do that we're not suppose to do anything that would
						upset the balance here. Our sponsor specifically said not to do anything
						that might require legal counsel to fix. In other words he's saying don't
						... get... arrested... Do you really want to risk that route?"</p>

					<p>"I went to another auction just to try and open up my memories of the day
						that Sarah disappeared." you say to Bernard who looks a bit curious as to
						what you will say next. "There was a man there, I think his name was
						'Asiago'. He was bidding at this auction. The funny thing is that he also
						bought a painting at the auction that day that Sarah and I purchased a
						painting. I guess that in itself isn't terribly coincidental, but I recall
						him buying the painting auctioned off right before the one that we
						purchased. I'm wondering if there's some connection. Maybe our paintings
						were mixed up."</p>
					<p>You pause for a second and grab a drink from Bernard's mini bar.
						"Interestingly enough Mr. Asiago wasn't alone. And, he didn't seem much like
						an art critic either. All in all, it was strange watching him bid, it was as
						if he didn't care about the price of the painting. He would stare down the
						people who bid against him as if they were insulting him or something. He
						seemed a bit dangerous, but maybe that's just his bidding strategy although
						it didn't seem to work very well."</p>

					<p>Bernard opens the door to let you in. Without saying a word he goes to his

						operation into motion don't think that you or I are the only ones involved.
						When you're late you're make the entire team late. Don't forgot that because
						they may keep you waiting in return as payback someday when you can least

				<content>
					<p>"What about the security systems, or should we try to work around them?" you
						say with a bit of sarcasm. Once again Bernard replies "Today is someday.
						Assume they're disabled."</p>
					<p>Bernard finishes gathering his things and you both leave the room. The
						Auction house is on one of the top levels of the ship which takes about 10
						minutes to get to.</p>
					<p>While walking there Bernard tells you that there are no records of anyone
						named "Asiago" on this ship. He then slips you a walkie-talkie. In a low
						tone he says "Keep this, if there is a problem I will call you on it. I'm
						going to be handling watch this time. You go in and crack the safe (assuming
						one is present)."</p>
					<p>"Also no flashlights at all! With all those windows people can see you for
						miles in the dark up there." He's referring to the fact that the Auction
						House has an amazing 360 degree view looking down over most of the ship and
						out over hundreds of miles of ocean. The outside walls are created with
						glass tiles from floor to ceiling with a downward angle. "Instead use this."
						Bernard motions his eyes to his bag which has a mechanical looking
						contraption. Night vision goggles you quickly realize.</p>
					<p>You arrive at the Auction House and Bernard pauses to setup a remote motion
						detector behind the potted plants next to the doors.</p>
					<p>He then pulls out another goodie, a phone, a cellphone that looks about
						three times bigger than your common cellphone. He walks over to the windows
						and hesitates for a minute while looking down at the phone's display screen.
						You gather that he's waiting to pick up a signal. Finally he starts dialing
						a number. "We're in place." you hear him say. After a moment he seems to
						hear a response and hangs up putting the phone back into the bag.</p>
					<p>While on board there's one thing that you haven't in particular seen, cell
						phones. They don't work on board. There is no cell tower unless you want to
						pay exorbitant prices to use the ships cell phone service. What Bernard
						pulled out wasn't a cell phone, it was a satellite phone and you didn't even
						know he had one. You're guessing he just made a satellite call to someone
						else on the ship. Someone who was expecting a call probably because the sat
						phones don't work indoors, so the person had to be either outside or close
						to the exterior of the ship.</p>
					<p>Bernard takes his post in a crawl space in the shadows behind the elevator.
						He sets up a digital display to the remote camera. If anything comes up that
						elevator he'll see it before they get close to the Auction House as the
						elevator level readout (in big red numbers) will show if someone is
						approaching.</p>
					<p>From his crawlspace he also has a good view of the staircase leading up to
						the Auction House. He grabs the walkie-talkie from his belt and says
						"Check". You answer back "Check" and he gives you the thumbs up.</p>
					<p>Time to start cracking locks. You reach into your backpack and pull out a
						pair of latex gloves and a rubber mask (in case there are cameras inside the
						Auction house). Bernard motions to you from his corner that the mask is
						unnecessary, so you put it back in your bag. There is definitely an insider
						here you realize. Someone who can cover up the video evidence.</p>
					<p>You grab your lock picking tools from a small sack (small enough to fit in
						your pocket). Quickly you look over the lock again and pull out the pieces
						you need. Slipping the small metal clips into the lock you pull out another
						tool, this one looks like a plastic gun of some sort. You hook the metal
						clips into the plastic tool and turn it on. It starts to vibrate vigorously.
						One hand handles the pick and the other holding the lock gun. All said and
						done the door is open in less than a minute. You quickly enter and close the
						door behind yourself.</p>
					<p>After closing the door it takes a second for your eyes to adjust. It's dark
						in here but you can still see a bit. The moon is out and casts a shadow into
						the room. The painting are all lined up in a circle around the perimeter of
						the room with plenty of space between them. You take a quick second to
						glance out the windows.</p>
					<p>A storm is brewing on the horizon. From the looks of it a violent storm by
						that. You can see the lightning flashes in the distance which cast light
						into the room through the glass walls. You walk towards the purchasing
						counter, another flash of light showers the room showing details of the
						painting in a disturbing and fragmented light. Suddenly the light from the
						moon is gone, the thunder clouds have won the sky.</p>
					<p>You take this opportunity to pull out the night vision goggles that Bernard
						gave you. Dawning the gear objects take on a red tinge. Depth perception is
						difficult, but possible as you gingerly move through the paintings toward
						the cashier counter. Behind the counter is a door. You quickly check all of
						the drawers in the cashier counter looking for the receipt book, but nothing
						comes up. It must be that the door!</p>
					<p>You recall that it surprised you that they were using a receipt book in the
						first place. In this day of digital availability why would someone still use
						a book for anything. But, digital transactions are not as easy to conceal.
						"Maybe we're not the first thieves here?" you ponder.</p>
					<p>You glance out the windows and notice clouds rolling in from all directions.
						How odd that they would all be rolling in this way. Must be a very low
						pressure system directly above the ship. The weather is getting worse and
						the paintings look even more creepy as the brightness from the lightning
						strikes overload your night vision goggles and send them into a flat screen
						of crimson. The goggles restore to normal after ten seconds or so.</p>
					<p>"Time to start on the door...". You pull out your tools again and put them
						in the lock as before. The lock is a solid deadbolt, and the going is a bit
						slower. After five minutes of work you get the "click" and the door opens.
						You move in, but this time you don't lock the door behind you.</p>
					<p>It is completely dark in this room, but you keep the lights off nonetheless.
						The goggles work well enough to do the job. In red outline you can make out
						a row of paintings carefully stacked next to each other. You take a quick
						look hoping to get lucky and find something useful, and are rewarded.
						Although it is very dark, the night vision goggle bring out unique swirls in
						one of the paintings. In particular this is the painting that should have
						been delivered to your cabin. The painting that you and Sarah purchased! It
						seems like a lifetime ago at this point. Now you are certain that the
						painting you received was in fact another.</p>
					<p>The safe itself is very obviously displayed in the back corner. You quickly
						take some electronic equipment out of your bag and place it on the safe.
						Your equipment has a magnetic backing so it stays in place just fine.
						Fortunately this is your standard internal mechanical safe and not one of
						the newer electronic safes that require quite a bit more effort.</p>
					<p>Your electronic equipment does most of the work for you, all you have to do
						is turn the spindle slowly and the equipment can pinpoint the spindle
						inflections with a meter. Cracking the safe only takes you about 5 minutes.
						"Got to love technology" you think and pull the large handle opening the
						safe.</p>
					<p>Opening the door the first thing that you notice is that it is almost empty
						except for a single item. The receipt book sits lonely in the safe.</p>
					<p>Quickly grabbing the book you thumb through the pages trying to find the
						latest auctions. You find it, and pull out your mini camera snapping photos
						of all auctions in the last week (including the auction that you and Sarah
						purchased a painting at).</p>
					<p>After you finish taking pictures you put the book back in the safe exactly
						were you found it and take a second to look a bit more. A few valuable items
						are present: a gold pendant, a sapphire studded necklace, an opal turquoise
						and diamond broach.</p>
					<p>You notice one final item that seems horribly out of place. A small hand
						written map of some sort. Possibly a small drawing with directions you
						gather. You grab it and snap a photo, then put it back and make one final
						look to make sure nothing is out of place. Then you close the door and spin
						the dial back to the exact position you found it.</p>
					<p>Making your way to the door you make sure all of your gear is accounted for
						and move through the door closing it. Once again you pull out your tools and
						work the deadbolt until it locks from the outside. "Making good time" you
						think to yourself and work your way through the lined up paintings to the
						front door.</p>
					<p>A lighting flash occurs overloading your night-vision goggles and you miss a
						half step knock over a painting and it crashes to the floor. Extremely
						fortunately it did not rip so you set it back up and quickly leave the room.</p>
					<p>Leaving the Auction House you once again pull out your locksmith tools and
						work the lock closed from the outside. You turn around and motion to Bernard
						who moves out from his position, picks up his remote camera/motion sensor,
						and moves to the window area. He makes a quick call on his sat phone saying
						only one work "Finished", and quickly hangs up. He then turns to follow you
						and you both move into the elevator in an organized fashion.</p>
					<p>"Did you get the safe?" Bernard asks "Yes." you reply. "Was the book in the
						safe?" Bernard asks "Yes." you reply again. Bernard pats you gently on the
						back "Well done then" .</p>
					<p>As the elevator descends back to your level you take off your latex gloves.
						You both go back to Bernard's room. Bernard pulls out his laptop and you
						give him the memory stick from the camera. He plugs it into his computer and
						starts uploading the images.</p>
					<p>As the images finish uploading you and Bernard look through them. "There!"
						you say pointing to a photo with a line item from "Hijiru Asiago". The only
						other information on the line is what looks like a bank routing number and a
						stamp that says "Paid" running across the entry.</p>
					<p>Scanning it closer Bernard makes out one additional number. G34, "A room
						number" you say and Bernard nods his head in agreement. "I'll send these off
						and have the results back tomorrow morning, come back then.</p>
					<p>As you're leaving the room he says, "Don't do anything without letting me
						know first OK". You agree and wrap up all of your equipment and head out
						back to your cabin.</p>
					<p>It's very late, and the last couple of days have really exhausted you.</p>

					<p>The coincidences are too great, you need to test this Asiago character and
						see how much he wants the painting. Rudolphe said that this work was somehow
						more important that it looked, and you want to see if this is the case.</p>
					<p>Jumping into the auction at the last second, you throw out a bold figure of
						$37,000 (a full $5K more that the last bid). Quickly Asiago looks around the
						room and notices you. His eyes tear right through you as if you will pay for
						this. His outfit is impeccable; you notice that his suit is Armony.</p>
					<p>The auctioneer says "Going once, going twice," and you hear "$40,000," from
						the Asian man. Gasps are heard as the Rudolphe Thornden painting reaches
						$40,000, a price unheard of for a painter of his relative importance.</p>
					<p>The pressure is on, everyone is staring. You get the feeling that they're
						wondering why a man in a button up Hawaiian shirt with khaki pants would pay
						$40,000 for a painting by an virtually unknown artist. They all know that
						you're bluffing. But, you feel the need to know, with certainty, if this man
						is not bidding on the painting, but on something else about the painting
						that has a much higher value.</p>
					<p>"$50,000" you say, the sweat starting to pool along the back of your neck.
						The Asian man looks at you and mouths some words to someone next to him.
						"$60,000" he calmly says, and passes the ball back to your corner. The
						auctioneer looks at you in amazement, as well. How long will this go on, he
						seems to be wondering. "Going once, going twice," all eyes look to you.</p>
					<p>You decide to hold your tongue and feel like you got enough information from
						this session. "Going three times," the auctioneer says, "Sold to Mr.
						Asiago." The painting is quickly moved aside and another painting is brought
						to the stage.</p>
					<p>"Mr. Asiago, hey?" you say to yourself. You notice that he moves from his
						current location to the cashier table where the cashier waits with a receipt
						book (the same one you signed yesterday). You see several other people move
						out of the room just as soon as this auction finishes. "And it appears you
						came with friends, Mr. Asiago," you mutter to yourself.</p>

					<p>You see the painting that Rudolphe was mentioning. It has a very modernistic
						tone to it, with large streaks of gold running toward its center. The grey
						background of the work offsets the gold brilliantly. The painting is heavily
						textured and large. It could easily weight twenty pounds or more.</p>
					<p>The bidding has commenced and two attendees quickly bid up the price to tens
						of thousands of dollars. After a closer look you recognize one of the
						bidders. He attended the auction yesterday as well, in fact he bid on the
						painting just before the painting that you bought. This has to be some sort
						of coincidence, but your mind refuses to let go of it.</p>
					<p>A memory of the painting that the man purchased yesterday touches your mind.
						That painting was slightly larger than the one that you purchased. Thinking
						through it a bit more you remember how the package that you received at your
						cabin was also slightly larger than the painting you purchased.</p>
					<p>Connections are quickly being made in your mind. Maybe there was a mix-up.
						Maybe the painting that you received was the wrong painting! You didn't
						actually remove the butcher paper from the painting that you and Sarah
						received in your cabin, so you can't be sure. With that said replaying the
						events makes you feel confident that this is somehow related.</p>
					<p>The Asian gentleman doesn't seem concerned with the price of the painting,
						but still seems like he doesn't want to waste money. He has possibly the
						meanest stare you've ever seen and uses it to intimidate the other bidder,
						but it doesn't seem to be working too well. The painting quickly reaches
						$25,000. Finally at $32,000 the second man starts shows his first sign of
						hesitance and stops bidding.</p>
					<p>"Going once." still nothing from the second bidder. "Going twice," this
						could be it you think to yourself.</p>
					<p>Would you like to bid on the painting?</p>

					<p>Bernard opens the door and quickly motions for you to come in. "I have some
						good news," he says and moves to his computer to show you. "That long string
						of numbers was in fact a bank routing number leading to an account in
						Europe. I had some people working on it and they were able to place a name
						on the account, Kiyoshi Liang. He lists himself as an international supplier
						of Japanese dissent. The word is that he deals in some pretty dangerous
						stuff. Munitions, explosives, heavy machinery. This guy sounds like he's
						gearing up for World War III."</p>
					<p>"The good news is that now we have a solid link to a source that we can
						track down. I should have contact information on Mr. Liang soon, but it will
						take some time (probably a week or so). I know this doesn't help us during
						this journey, but it is a lead. Very good news if we don't find Sarah during
						the trip." Bernard says</p>
					<p>"Also, the security cameras around the Auction House have been cleaned." he
						says.</p>
					<p>You pause for a second, "And exactly how did you get access to the security
						cameras?"</p>
					<p>Bernard mumbles "Once again, you don't need to know. Just know that the
						Auction House camera footage won't come back to haunt you in the future."</p>
					<p>He pauses then continues, "Back to Mr. Liang, if we get an image of the guy
						we can scan all of the security footage on the entire ship for him. All we
						need is a clear shot of his face. I checked the ships phone records for the
						room number he listed, and it appears that he received a call. Unfortunately
						the number is listed as 'unknown'. I've been told that this is highly
						unusual, and somewhat impossible although it most definitely appears to be
						the case."</p>
					<p>Although Bernard seems very knowledgeable about the ship, you realize that
						he is just covering for his source.</p>
					<p>You're getting a bit antsy. "We have all this information. Why not just go
						down to the room and break in? Maybe she's in there", you say.</p>
					<p>Bernard doesn't seem to appreciate you even suggesting this cut-and-dry
						approach. "The room attendants have already been questioned about the room
						and they say there is no one else in it. In fact they say that there is
						nothing in it, not even a tooth brush. It doesn't look like he's using the
						room so it would be a waste of effort."</p>
					<p>After replying he slowly lowers his head as if disappointed in your
						suggestion, "Travis, this is a tough time for both of us. We can't afford to
						have you going off like you're John Wayne at every lead. I know time is of
						the essence but please think about what you say. Sarah's life may hang in
						the balance. If we act aggressively, her captors may see her as too much of
						a risk. Only God knows what they'd do to her then."</p>
					<p>The point is taken and you nod in agreement. You try to change the topic,
						"So basically right now we have a name, and an unused room," you say. "It
						doesn't seem like much really."</p>
					<p>"You and I know that it's not that simple, plus in a couple of days we
						should have more, but for the present you are correct."</p>

				<content>
					<p>The conversation you had with Mark earlier keeps ringing back into your
						head. What exactly did he mean by "people like you". You've been
						investigating the supernatural for the past twelve years, yet you must admit
						that you've felt like a circus sideshow on more than one occasion.</p>
					<p>The events while on the QE2 have been the pinnacle of enlightenment for your
						field, combining much of what you've trained for over a decade to achieve...
						actual contact with the spirit world.</p>
					<p>You've come to understand the goals of the spirits here.</p>
					<p>Mark said that he'd help you find Sarah. You shrug off the offer as that is
						what he's suppose to have been doing all along. When confronted about this
						you recall him saying, "I will redouble my efforts, you will not be
						disappointed."</p>
					<p>How can he say something like this for certain? Does he know where she is?
						You wouldn't be the least surprised if that were the case, but short of
						torturing the man how would you be able to get him to divulge the location
						unless you join his team.</p>
					<p>Mark seems to be very fluent in the operations of this ship and also the
						paranormal underworld terms and techniques. He would be a valuable asset,
						but Bernard has made it very clear that he is in charge of this operation.
						To confide in Mark is to join Mark's team. If Bernard were to catch wind, it
						would be over between the two of you, and that could hurt your career
						measurably.</p>
					<p>You think through the options on the table and feel that siding with Mark is
						your best option for finding Sarah. You slowly make your way up to his room
						and knock on the door.</p>
					<p>Mark answers the door and invites you in. The shades are drawn over his
						room's porthole window. Candles are lit in the room and you can't help but
						wonder why. You take a seat on a plush chair next to the table. He looks at
						you intently "What brings you here Travis?"</p>
					<p>You recall what the ghosts told you about not being the first PI's on this
						ship. Confidence builds up in you and you decide to throw this on the table
						early to see what he has to say about it. "I heard that we're not the first
						PI's assigned to this task. I heard that the others disappeared. Is this
						really what happened?"</p>
					<p>Mark seems surprised by the question and rises from his seat to walk to the
						desk.</p>
					<p>"I really am not sure Travis. I was assigned the task of finding private
						investigators with paranormal backgrounds to investigate strange occurrence
						on the ship only a year ago. Before that I was not privy to the
						information."</p>
					<p>He pauses for a moment. "It is possible, but I do not know of it." You
						wonder if this is trustworthy and realize that it makes no difference one
						way or the other. You already don't trust the man, so what answer exactly
						were you looking for you wonder.</p>
					<p>You then proceed to ask him if he has any new information about Sarah. He
						once again is on the defensive and answers almost like a script in a movie,
						"No, not at this time." nothing more. He seems like he's hiding something
						else. He follows up the question by flinging the hot potato back to you,
						"Have you found any new clues?"</p>
					<p>You get the feeling that he's just bating you for information so you return
						his answer "No, not at this time."</p>
					<p>Realizing that the table is now open for bargaining you think back to all of
						the information the ghosts have told you about Jonas and the documents that
						would incriminate him and his family. This is your pocket ace and you choose
						not to loose site of it. "You know Mark, the deeper I search the more
						questions I have."</p>
					<p>Mark looks at you a bit sideways understanding that you're setting something
						up. You continue, "I ran across something. Information linking Jonas's
						father, the founder of the family fortune, to strange occurrences and even
						stranger partnerships around the 1950's."</p>
					<p>Mark's expression turns to stone. You continue, "Many of these
						occurrences/partnerships seem harmless, but some of them seem to bear some
						weight." You move in closer to Mark, "Now, lets say that there existed some
						paperwork from Jonas's fathers era linking him to somewhat questionable
						partnerships, do you think this would be worth anything to you?"</p>
					<p>Mark moves in closer as well, "Ahh, a good old blackmail scheme. I see an
						opportunity to do some business here. Lets dispense with the formalities.
						Are you willing to be tied to my organization, because if I answer your
						questions I will require this. There is no formal contract, just an
						agreement between two people, old-fashion style."</p>
					<p>Realizing that you don't have many options for finding Sarah and realizing
						that Mark may be the best of the lot, you regretfully reply, "Yes."</p>
					<p>"You may not understand what I'm asking. This is a far larger deal than just
						you or I?" Mark says.</p>
					<p>Once again you realize the scope of his insistence and answer, "Lets do this
						deal."</p>
					<p>"Great, now we can move forward. What have you heard, I need specifics."</p>
					<p>You press him first, "First I want something from you, a straight answer on
						Sarah. Do you know where she is?"</p>
					<p>Mark seems a bit agitated, "I can only say that if you come through on your
						end. We will come through on our end. This is the offer, take it or leave
						it."</p>
					<p>You decide to tell him what you know. Slowly you mention what the ghosts
						told you about a room existing with a safe that contained paperwork
						revealing Jonas's fathers connection with several individuals and
						corporations throughout the world in a massive effort to artificially
						inflate oil prices.</p>
					<p>"We need names. Who told you this?" Mark presses you.</p>
					<p>Sensing that all options have run out for finding Sarah you pass on the
						names of the ghostly soul that you spoke with most often, "Madeline".</p>
					<p>Mark seems surprised. "Madeline you say?" He ruffles through paperwork on
						his desk finally stopping on a photo. He hands the photo to you. "Have you
						ever seen one of these before?"</p>
					<p>Looking at the photo you see a faceted globe looking to be 15 feet tall made
						of plates of crystal held together with iron riveted beams. The contraption
						has strange angles and a visible cable runs from the iron beams to what look
						like generators of sorts. You recognize the construction.</p>
					<p>"Is this by chance a containment field?"</p>
					<p>"You are correct, it is."</p>
					<p>"Where did you find it? I've only heard of these things in books."</p>
					<p>"The story is long, and I will fill you in on the specifics soon. It is on
						this ship, and it works. This is what you need to know right now. It's
						probably best if I just show it to you. Lets take a trip."</p>
					<p>With that Mark rises from his seat and heads toward the cabin door. You
						follow him out of the room and down several stories into the engine room
						area. Mark proceeds to tell you how an inventor that resided on the ship was
						responsible for putting this containment field together quite awhile ago.
						The inventor had perfected this device in a lab and seeked out the QE2 for a
						second incarnation of the machine.</p>
					<p>Mark opens a door, you behold the large crystal/iron structure in all of its
						glory. Inside you can see clouds floating around almost like anchovies in a
						fish tank. Moving closer you realize that these "clouds" are actually
						spirits each in miniature form seeming to be living out their individual
						existences in bizarre fashion. Large tubes seem to be channeling sunlight
						from outside the ship and focusing it into the crystal sphere.</p>
					<p>Mark walks up to the operator manning the controls, "Bring up Madeline."
						Soon thereafter Madeline takes form as all of the other spirits shrink to
						pinpoints that remind you of a star field. "Madeline!" Mark proclaims, "We
						have some information we'd like you to help us out with."</p>
					<p>The ghost looks around the room to answer back to Mark and sees you. "Oh my
						god" she mutters unable to keep her composure, "How can you do this to us!"
						she blasts at you. You decide to move back to a dark corner of the room in
						hopes that her view through the crystal is as distorted as your view of her.</p>
					<p>"Madeline," Mark says again, "We've come across some information that we
						need your help with. It appears that there are some documents that might
						have a very negative effect on my benefactor. Where are these documents!"</p>
					<p>Madeline doesn't want to give the information. Tapping the operator on the
						shoulder you witness as a mirror changes direction and a streak of sunlight
						touches Madeline. She shrieks in pain.</p>
					<p>Eventually Mark is capable of convincing her to divulge the information. She
						seems broken during the process. Sadness takes hold of you as you realize
						that you are the betrayer of many spirits. As Mark dismisses her into the
						background with all of the other spirits in the containment field she says
						something "Travis, he will blow up the ship!"</p>
					<p>"Silence!" Mark says , "That is all Madeline" and with that she shrinks down
						to a pin sized star in the star field.</p>
					<p>Mark then turns to you, "Thank you for your service Travis. Are business
						here is done for now. When the time is right meet me up on the Litto deck.
						You will know when the time is right. Your presence here confirmed your
						commitment. I will not forget it." Mark moves you to the door and escorts
						you out of the room.</p>
					<p>You wonder if you've just been conned into giving away the only piece of
						information you had to bargain with. Something in Mark's voice tells you
						that he will honor his words. You wait for the moment and hope.</p>
					<p>Almost an entire day passes and you do your best to keep in your cabin at
						all times.</p>
					<p>Suddenly something rocks the ship. An explosion followed by another
						explosion. You hear the sirens and the men on the intercom telling
						passengers to report to their predesignated evacuation areas. You recall
						Mark's words, "Meet me on the Litto deck", and realize that this is the
						moment that Mark was referring to. Quickly you move up to the Litto deck as
						directed.</p>
					<p>When you get there no one is present. You move around the deck looking for
						something, anything that might have a clue from Mark. Finally you find a
						note sticking out from underneath a table centerpiece. "Thank you for your
						service to our cause. The information you gave was valuable." This was all
						that the note said.</p>
					<p>As the ship start to rock violently you start to get desperate. Turning over
						the note you see something written on the back. It is a number 486. You
						instantly realize that this is a room number and run down to the room.
						Fortunately it is on this deck.</p>
					<p>Breaking through the door you rush into the room looking for Sarah. You open
						the bathroom door and see a woman tied in the bathtub. Sarah! She sees and
						her eyes open full wide. You help her to her feet and out of the tub,
						untying her bonds.</p>
					<p>She seems hurt but capable of movement so you both rush out of the room and
						down to the evacuation decks. Before too long you board a life boat and
						lower to the ocean making your way to an island off in the distance.</p>
					<p>You both live happily ever after and never hear from Mark again. Many people
						question you about finding Sarah in the final moments, but you just chalk it
						up to a clue you found earlier in the day.</p>
					<p>The End.</p>

					<p>Madeline made it very clear that they expected the documents that
						incriminate Jonas to be delivered to David, and rightfully so considering
						the number of lives (or deaths) that hang in the balance. The problem that
						you see is that you made a deal with the ghosts, and you want to make sure
						that they understand this and that they deliver on their promises (which is
						a pretty tall order to enforce for an apparition).</p>
					<p>They expect you to hand off the documents to David. But, will he have the
						information you need, the information that tells you where to find Sarah?
						You doubt it so you doubt that you will be handing off the documents when
						you visit David. Nevertheless he is the contact point, the "vessel" into the
						world of the living that the ghosts rely on for important tasks.</p>
					<p>Many questions jump through your mind almost all at the same time. "Why do
						they trust David?", "How long has David worked for the ghosts?", "Why is he
						doing this for them?". You decide not to muddle the conversation with such
						questions right off the bat. Instead you will stick to the question that you
						need answered "Where is Sarah!"</p>
					<p>Returning to your cabin you gather up the documents and place them in a thin
						backpack underneath your shirt that is small enough not to be visually
						noticeable through your clothes. Not much of a hiding place, but good enough
						for the hand-off (if one actually takes place). You gather up your standard
						gear and head into the Hallway.</p>
					<p>Looking down the corridor you see a couple of people walking towards you.
						The backpack starts to chafe a little bit against your skin and you start to
						get nervous. The documents you're carrying seem to weigh you down not with
						mass alone, but with the implications of the seemingly needless atrocities
						created as a result of their existence.</p>
					<p>Glancing through the photos of the documents you took earlier you recall the
						official looking stamps by the various parties involved. The ornate ink
						blots on the contract had an err of civility, but also reminders of distrust
						between the parties for the ink stamps themselves seemed to bear very fine
						hidden shapes in the patterns (thinly veiled to prevent forgeries). Some of
						the shapes are pretty obvious and some were much more subtle.</p>
					<p>Now that you're in the hallway the next question is where to find David. You
						recall that he seems to work most hours of the day, but today he seems
						nowhere to be found. You move up and down the corridor with no luck. You
						decide to try down another corridor where you see a cleaning cart parked
						next to an open door. You walk up to the opened door and look inside seeing
						a room attendant, but not the one you were hoping for.</p>
					<p>The lady in the room is making the bed and looks up to catch your gaze.
						"Hello, have you seen David around here." She replies back with a gentle
						"No," followed by shaking of her head from side to side to communicate this
						in a non verbal language.</p>
					<p>"By chance do you know where I can find him?" you ask. The woman puts the
						pillow down and moves closer to you. You realize that she is very young and
						probably not very used to people asking questions of her as her English is
						somewhat choppy. "Ah, he not down here for several hours. Probably in crew
						area, you can't go there though, only for crew."</p>
					<p>Realizing that this woman seems to know David pretty well you pour on the
						charisma "Well, I have some important things that he requested I get him. I
						know you're probably busy right now, but it is very important that I speak
						with him." She thinks for a couple of seconds and repeats what you've said.
						"Very important?" she asks. "Yes, very very important." you reply back. She
						seems like a friend of David as these words affect her and she moves into
						the hallway looking both ways and locks the door behind herself, you notice
						her name tag "Maria".</p>
					<p>"I can take you to his room, but you will have to be quick. Passengers not
						allowed in crew area." You nod in agreement and follow as she heads down the
						hallway to a part of the wall with a crease in the wallpaper and a small
						keyhole that is almost unnoticeable and seems to blend in with the
						wallpaper.</p>
					<p>The door opens and she motions for you to go into the doorway, closing it
						behind yourself. The corridor you step into is a bit dark and has a faint
						green tint to it probably from the lighting. The floor is a smooth rubbery
						substance. You look down the length of this crew corridor and notice the
						hustle and bustle of several people moving rapidly with a purpose. Grabbing
						things, placing things, talking with others about what is needed and what
						needs to be done. They seem not to notice you and Maria seems intent on
						keeping it so.</p>
					<p>She grabs your attention and you follow her down the corridor. She soon take
						a right at the first intersection and down a set of metal stairs with grated
						metal flooring. The space seems to be getting even more cramped, and you
						walk through a couple of water tight doors before stopping in front of a
						doorway into a small room filled with bunk beds. Maria walks in and sure
						enough finds David in his bed. She pokes his shoulder and he opens his eyes
						"Oh, Maria. What brings you here."</p>
					<p>His voice is clear and friendly. Maria replies "David, this gentleman says
						that he has something very important for you so I brought him down here at
						once. I'll head back to my rooms. Just thought this might help." She smiles
						to David. You get the feeling that these two are more than just friends.</p>
					<p>David moves to an upright position in his bunk and smiles warmly back,
						"Thanks Maria." With that she turns and leaves the room with you two. The
						smile toward Maria leaving turns into a questioning look when focused on
						you. "Maria mentioned something important Mr. Neff?" David says to you while
						getting up and putting his shirt on.</p>
					<p>"Um... yes, very important documents for sure. By chance have you hear of
						these documents before?" you question David to find out if he's already been
						informed by the ghosts.</p>
					<p>"Yes I have, this is not the place to discuss these matters though" David
						says pointing to the doorway which buzzes from the more than occasional
						person walking down the corridor. "I know a place where we can speak in
						private." David says while putting on his shoes. "Did you bring the
						documents?" he asks. You nod your head. "Ok, follow me." and David looks out
						to the corridor looking down to make sure no one is there for the moment. He
						motions with his hand for you to follow.</p>
					<p>Moving swiftly he takes a left turn at the first corridor and into another
						passageway. You follow close behind down a flight of stairs to a much less
						populated floor. "This area is mainly used for storage. There's a back door
						though." You both make your ways to the back of the room. The lighting is
						dismal but David seems to know his way pretty well.</p>
					<p>Coming to the door David opens it and motions for you to stay back. He moves
						through the door and into what looks like a passenger area (you guess by the
						trim on the hallway and the carpeting). Shortly he returns and motions for
						you to come out. The door closes behind you and you notice that it is of the
						same type of doorway that you used to enter the crew area with, a thinly
						disguised secret compartment.</p>
					<p>Upon entering the passageway the first thing you notice is the panels of
						thick glass that seem to be looking out into a tank of some sort. You see
						things bobbing around in the tank, people. This is the underside of a pool,
						giving you an aquarium view. You watch the people swimming in the pool
						noticing how uniquely each person moves through the water.</p>
					<p>The light beaming into the passageway has a waviness like the ripples of the
						pool. You reflect on how strange it dances around the room. What an illusion
						it can be, and how little do we really know about it.</p>
					<p>David turns to talk with you, all the while the light from the underwater
						glass seems to wave over his skin. "Few passengers know about this area. It
						should be safe to talk here. The exits are visible so we'll know if someone
						approaches." he says.</p>
					<p>"David, I have the documents and I'll give them to you, but first I want the
						information that I was promised about Sarah. That was the deal."</p>
					<p>He takes his glasses off and polishes them with his shirt cloth and says "I
						do not know of the deal you mention. They did not tell me of this." He puts
						his glasses back on and looks at you. This is obviously a stalemate of some
						sort and you both stand quite for a minute hypnotized by the deep blue
						colors in the pool that this vantage point provides.</p>
					<p>"Can you speak with them and get this information? Can it be done here, or
						does it need to be somewhere specific?" you ask. David looks away and starts
						to pace the room nervously. "I can call them, but I do not know if they will
						heed the calls. You may be able to communicate with them, but I will more
						than likely not be able to participate. From what I've gathered your gifts
						with the supernatural far outshine mine."</p>
					<p>With that he closes and chants a simple mantra over and over. After several
						repetitions you notice several shapes taking form in the swimming pool.
						Ghostly passengers floating in black tire-like inner tubes reminiscent of
						days long since passed. Ghostly kids jumping into the pool while chasing one
						another. A figure materializes at the bottom of the pool seeming to hover
						there.</p>
					<p>You can hear a female voice "I have been summoned. What is your reason?" Her
						flowing gown seems to defy gravity in long textured swaths of fabric. David
						keeps chanting the mantra oblivious to the question of the elegant woman
						looking at them through the glass of the pool. You recall that David
						mentioned that he would not be able to communicate with the ghosts as you do
						so you assume that he hasn't heard the woman.</p>
					<p>"I've summoned you to finalize this arrangement and provide me information
						to the whereabouts of my friend Sarah." you say.</p>
					<p>She replies, "Your friend you say. I believe the strand of your relationship
						is stronger than you care to admit Travis. Your friend indeed, said by
						someone who refuses to admit more than friendship. Yet, you have risked in
						order that you might find your 'friend', so I will honor our deal and
						provide you what I know." the ghost says.</p>
					<p>"It is doubtful that you will save her as you must line up several draws
						perfectly to be privy to that information. We ghosts know not everything,
						but we do know the ways to the heart. I can sense Sarah's heart still
						beating, and still hoping for your 'friendship' to save her." a raspy sneer
						in her voice seems to emphasize he distaste for the word 'friend'.</p>
					<p>"She is waiting for you Mr. Neff, find the key to her heart, and you will
						find your lost love. A heart needs a home..." the spirit says. "Now, the
						documents please..." The spirit holds out her hand pointing to David. You
						reach under you shirt and around your waist to the pack under your shirt.
						You pull the documents out and hold them in the air.</p>
					<p>"Your riddles are cryptic and seem far less useful then what I was offered.
						Yet, here are your documents, as I know how important they are to your
						kind." you say forcefully, momentarily worried that your voice may have
						traveled too far.</p>
					<p>The spirit replies "We know no more about her. We see things only as pieces
						from your world and must guess much with little. Thank you for giving us the
						documents as many of us are dependent on them to reach the proper end of
						life. I wish I had something real for you to work with, but alas this is not
						the case. I translate the fortunes in the clouds of my world, nothing more."</p>
					<p>The ghostly spirit slowly fades away and David sensing the end of the
						conversation stops with the chanting.</p>
					<p>You hand the documents to David. He takes the documents and quickly looks
						them over. In a somewhat exhausted voice he says "This burnt bridge is
						finally being rebuilt about several decades. Thank you for your help here
						Mr. Neff." You nod at the compliment but in your mind you're thinking over
						what the spirit said to you "Find the key to her heart," what the hell does
						that mean you wonder.</p>
					<p>"There is one thing that I was told to pass onto you when you presented the
						documents." David says. "Several years back a group of individuals took the
						same voyage as you are on right now. They boarded at the same port and were
						scheduled to depart at the same destination. Their passports were false as
						you and your friends passports are. They carried the same type of equipment
						in their personal luggage, and scored the ship for the same type of
						information."</p>
					<p>"Unfortunately they never made it to their destination. It is very odd when
						a group of people disappears on a ship, but stranger things have happened on
						this ship as you've already seen. Be safe Mr. Neff as you have not been told
						the whole story. Question those who put you into this situation and did not
						inform you that you were not their first choice for this mission."</p>
					<p>With that David walks through the door to the right of the tank. "So we're
						not the first PI's here, and the last ones never made it back." you think to
						yourself. Your faith in Bernard is wavering a bit as is your faith in
						yourself for trusting the sponsors of this trip. "Central!" you mutter in
						disgust realizing that Central has held very pertinent information from you
						that would have swayed your decision to take on this journey. Sarah has
						disappeared, and you and Bernard may be in grave danger.</p>
					<p>Looking into the pool your struck by how the deep blue tiles on the bottom
						of the pool remind you of how deep and dark the levels of intrigue have
						peeled down to in this seemingly simple project. You were hired to
						investigate strange occurrences on the Queen Elizabeth II. Instead you're
						starting to feel that you'd been hand picked for a far different purpose.</p>

					<p>Returning to your cabin you enter. You take the precaution of closing the
						door and locking it behind you. The ghostly Madeline that you spoke to
						earlier said that all you need to do is dial #999 on your cabin phone. What
						will happen you wonder. She didn't say and you didn't think to ask. Picking
						up the phone you hesitate. "Why am I doing this?" you ask yourself. "Is it
						for Sarah? Or, is it something else?". The ghost Madeline mentioned some
						grand conspiracy that spread across the globe. Judging from the things
						you've witnessed while aboard you feel that she may, in fact, have been
						telling the truth. "She mentioned wars and destruction, a global energy
						monopoly. Can it be?" A whisper in your head answers your question
						"Yeeeessss".</p>
					<p>The Queen Elizabeth II was the flagship of the British Empire as the empire
						was in retreat. England finally stabilized and morphed into the global
						economy of today. The QE2 was the pinnacle representation of the strength at
						it's peak. As it traveled the oceans from continent to continent it had a
						civilizing impact along the way, but in a ominously forceful demeanor. An
						amazing feet of man, a reminder of the power of the aristocracy and the
						nobility of Britain. Gently it told the world along its routes that they
						needed to organize for a larger cause or forever be subservient to the
						massive potential of a larger humanity.</p>
					<p>With this power followed a concept that was as naive as the QE2 was massive,
						the burdening of an entire race to civilize the world. More commonly know as
						White Man's Burden. A slap in the face of the peaceful societies that the
						ship traveled freely to and from. And a foundation for more despicable
						reasoning such as social Darwinism that grabbed following in many of the
						societies of the world. Eventually climaxing in the second great war WW2.</p>
					<p>The voice of truth in your mind reminds you of the commonly accepted truths
						of life only a blink of an eye behind. The brutality of life and the
						corruption that crippled the British Empire, the awakening of those
						subjugated, and th downfall of England. A society once ruling the planet,
						but now struggling to alliance itself to maintain it's way of life.</p>
					<p>"What does this safe contain?" Curiosity strokes your interest. "What deals
						were made on this ship?" You recall the saying that the victors write the
						history, but in the open age of the present, with information moving at the
						speed of light, truths have rewritten history to a more just description.
						How will these documents add to that global truth you wonder. The gas crises
						of the 70's realigned the world as oil became the new currency, and those
						with it fought to become the new leaders.</p>
					<p>You dial the number on the phone # - 9 - 9 - 9 . An electronic message
						greets you on the phone "We're sorry but that number is not valid."
						Discouraged you hang the phone up. How could this be you wonder. Jogging
						back in your memory you can remember Madelin's lips saying the number
						"Pound. Nine. Nine. Nine". You roll onto the bed and close your eyes to
						relax your mind for a second and think clearly. Opening your eyes you notice
						a light blue silhouette on the walls, just like the other night except these
						blue flames are visible even in the light of the room. A voice trailing down
						the room softly calls out the words "Come".</p>
					<p>You follow. Unlocking the door you open it and can see the flames moving
						down the hallway. A man is walking by as you peer out the door. He's walking
						right through the blue flames but seems to take no notice. You move down the
						hallway glancing over at the flames occasionally. They take you past the
						lobby area and to a stairway leading down. After a several levels of decent
						the stairway changes from lush carpeting and edged trim to white metal
						painted walls with steal girders. The signs on the wall no longer convey a
						sense of civility, but are dry red signs with directions such as "emergency"
						and "no access". You keep moving down until a locked door stops your decent
						with a sign saying "crew only". The blue flames move through the wall and
						you hear a click and can see the handles on the water tight door move
						counter clockwise. The door opens.</p>
					<p>You move through and see the flame waiting patiently on the other side.
						Pipes run along the top walls strapped together into a bundle and running
						down the length of the dull white hallway, with some pipes branching off
						from the bundle at each corridor. The flame starts moving again, and
						abruptly takes a right turn into a room. You follow hesitantly. The flame
						seems to be moving behind a large set of lockers, and then you hear
						something. Down the hall a creaking noise is slowly approaching so you
						follow the flame behind the lockers peering out to catch a glimpse of the
						approaching noise. A man walks right past the opening of the room pushing a
						bucket with a mop in it. Fortunately he doesn't see you.</p>
					<p>You look down at your clothes and realize that your attire has much to be
						desired for this area. If a crew member finds you down here you need an
						excuse of some sort. You start planning your excuse and decide to track more
						closely with the blue flame. The flame moves out from the lockers and
						continues down the hallway, down a set of stairs into a room that feels like
						a sauna. The noise is louder in here. You can hear a steady repetitive thud
						thud thud from the equipment. Lining the walls are once again large pipes.
						The space makes you think that the machines are the important part here and
						that human passage is an afterthought. Large thick wires line the walls and
						sometimes nosedive through the grated floors into large machines you can see
						underneath your feet far past the gratings.</p>
					<p>Green lights flash at various intersections of large conduit pipes into
						metal boxes with big "Emergency Shutoff" buttons labeled large enough for
						you to see 30 meters away in this god forsaken place. The air is dense, and
						the heat is rising. Sweat starts dampen your clothes. The blue flame seems
						to have no trouble with the white grated flooring and weaves itself in
						between the white metal railings which prevent you from possibly falling 20
						meters below. You're surprised at how high you are. The lighting seems too
						dim at the edges as you enter a larger space and the bottom seems to drop
						even further into a mass of interconnected pipes and large metal machinery.
						Now sweat pours from your face as your eyes adjust to the contrast between
						the perfectly lit walkway and the surrounding machinery that is dimly lit
						and heavily shadowed.</p>
					<p>A metal scaffolding seems to be holding the walkway in place, and expands
						into a large rectangular structure that upon closer inspection is a
						staircase supported by metal girders and connected platforms. The blue flame
						moves down the staircase and you follow although the heat is rising and
						feels like above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The air is dry with a slight
						burning odor to it, the sound from the machinery is getting louder as you
						approach.</p>
					<p>Finally you get to the bottom of the staircase and stand on a solid level of
						the flooring. Sparsely places halogen lights line the way like street lights
						around a huge mechanical structure. You hear a voice off in the distance
						"All readings look right on the mark, the coolant temperature fluctuation
						seems to be corrected," a large man says into his walkie talkie. The voice
						through the walkie talkie replies "OK, why don't you come back up and we can
						monitor it from here for now." "Roger that," the man says and makes a B-line
						to the stairs you just came from. He doesn't notice you behind the boxes in
						the shadow and quickly ascends the staircase.</p>
					<p>The blue flame moves forward around the machinery and ducks back into an
						unlit corner. You follow as the flame brightens the area immediately around
						it. You stop at what looks like a vent of some sort. You can feel a cool
						breeze coming out of it relieving you from the immense heat just a bit. The
						corners of the vent start to glow blue and the screws attaching it to the
						wall seem to magically unscrew themselves. the vent falls to the floor which
						makes little noticeable impact considering the surrounding sound levels. The
						blue flame moves into the vent and you can see that it seems to want you to
						crawl in and follow. If it wasn't cool air coming out of the vent you might
						be a bit more hesitant, but given the circumstances the cool air is a
						welcome relief so you move into the vent and start crawling. It seems to
						hold your weight just fine and you wonder if it was designed for such a
						task. The flame moves forward and you follow further.</p>
					<p>The inside of the vent is a smooth polished metal but shows signs of wear
						and tear with dents pock marking it at several spots. The flame moves a bit
						faster then you can travel leaving you in the dark for a bit. The thought of
						the immense weight of this ship suddenly grips your nerves as the darkness
						reminds you of how vulnerable you are in your current situation. If
						something were to happen to you right now you realize that no one would
						probably find you down here for a very long time. Once again refocusing on
						your purpose you're pulled back from this realization. "Sarah," you mutter
						and move forward catching up with the flame which takes an even smaller air
						duct to the right and stops. You move in closer and to see a vent into what
						looks like a study of some sort. The cover of the vent turns a light blue
						color and you hear the screws of the vent cover fall to the floor with the
						cover itself shortly thereafter.</p>
					<p>You enter the room with the blue flame which lights the room for you. It
						looks like some sort of study with reading chairs situated on a plush carpet
						and a wall of books lining two of the walls. The dust in the air is heavy.
						The books look ancient with a thick layer of dust on them. The air of the
						engine area must have kept the contents of this room very dry because no
						mold or mildew seems to be obvious. Something tells you that this room
						hasn't been used for several decades. As you move into the room you notice
						your foot prints are leaving noticeable clean areas on the hardwood floors.
						You feel like you're walking into a tomb as opposed to a room.</p>
					<p>A green waving light clashes with the blue flame and a greenish figure makes
						an outline and then seems to materialize. After a second you realize that
						this figure is Madeline. She pauses as if the process of opening
						communications with you takes more than a moment. "Hello Mr. Neff." she says
						to you but looks away as she says this. "Hello Madeline," you reply back.
						"This is the room right?"</p>
					<p>"Yes of course, it was closed off long ago, probably by design. The doors to
						your left do not open, they can not open because a wall has been placed
						right outside of the doors. This room is now a tomb dedicated to the
						despicable dealings from long ago. A museum of sorts," Madeline says. "My
						time is shorter than usual this deep into the ship. The electromagnetism is
						strong. We should start to work," the flame moves toward the bookcase. and
						seems to throw the books off of one of the shelves. A panel opens up showing
						a safe with a Starfish shaped handle. "This is where we need your expertise
						Mr. Neff".</p>
					<p>You step toward the safe and pull a small package out of your pocket.
						Opening the package you assemble an instrument that looks similar to a
						stethoscope. You lodge the ear bud in place and place the round end piece on
						the safe door next to the dial. Slowly you move the dial counter clockwise.
						You recall that the safe actually looks similar to the ones you used to
						practice on as a kid. You're confidence grows a bit. Then looking around you
						notice that another ghostly figure has appeared in the room and seems to be
						pacing the study area rapidly while talking with Madeline. At this point
						you've grown rather accustomed to the specters, which is a bit startling in
						itself.</p>
					<p>Somehow this doesn't distract you from you course. You think that you've
						cracked it and twist the lever, but nothing happens so you start again by
						rotating the dial several times to reset it. You mention to the specters
						"Often this takes several attempts to get it."</p>
					<p>The man in the top hat and formal attire looks over to you briefly. "Sir,
						we've tried that very method several times and haven't had success. It is
						difficult to crack a lock while also working to span the dimensions between
						different worlds. I hope you have better luck than I." The tone of his voice
						is a disturbing high pitched muddle and doesn't sit well with you. This
						character seems more determined than Madeline, and he seems like he has
						expectations that need to be fed. You wonder if he was this crude of a
						personality in real life or if that is a result of his afterlife. You try
						again, still nothing.</p>
					<p>A couple more tries go by and the ghosts seem to be getting impatient. The
						gentleman whispers to Madeline and glares back at you reproachfully. "Sir,
						do you not have any other tools that can be used to speed up this process?
						It is difficult for us to maintain our connection with your world over this
						duration."</p>
					<p>You reply back that this is the only tool you should need and it is in fact
						the only tool that you have that would work on an 85 year old safe. The
						gentleman seems a bit agitated but caps his emotions and starts pacing
						again. The air in the room seems to get a bit hotter and you're having
						trouble concentrating. You say to the gentleman "I think I can get this, and
						I can bring the documents by later on if that works better."</p>
					<p>They seem a bit shocked at your offer, possibly the candor in your voice you
						wonder. The cultural differences are quite great between a "gentleman" such
						this ghost and a modern day man such as yourself. You attempt to rephrase
						your statement "Sir, the lock is proving to be problematic and it may
						require more effort than I had hoped," and you leave it at that. This
						rephrasing doesn't seem to change his mood much and he doesn't respond to
						the idea of having the items "dropped off". This man wants to see whatever
						is in the safe, and now.</p>
					<p>You struggle through a couple more attempts and finally seem to make some
						progress. Your pretty sure about the first two numbers, but the last number
						keeps giving you problems. Finally like a stick of butter you pull the
						handle again and this time it opens. The gentleman specter stops his pacing
						and moves toward the safe quickly and aggressively. You open the door wide.</p>
					<p>The safe contains several items one of which is a stack of papers bundled
						together with a string and a folder. The specter grabs the documents and
						moves them over to the desk. All the time Madeline is so close she is
						practically breathing down his neck. You find a envelope opener on the desk
						and cut through the string. Opening the folder they find a stack of papers
						roughly 30 pages thick. Shuffling through the papers they see: satellite
						maps, various financial paperwork, black and white photos of guests on the
						ship at dinner smiling toward the camera, and a contract of sorts written on
						parchment in ink with several signatures at the bottom.</p>
					<p>The gentleman specter moves a step back as you take over shuffle through the
						paperwork. He must be getting tired you wonder. He says "Madeline, the
						paperwork is still intact. Thank God for the extremely dry air in here."
						Madeline nods at the gentleman as if subservient in some way. They both look
						to you, "Mr. Neff, we need you to drop these papers off as soon as possible.
						We can not carry them out of here. It must be you."</p>
					<p>Madeline steps in saying "We have arranged a courier that you already know.
						He is your room attendant David." Your eyes rifle toward Madeline and you
						say "I thought you said you weren't able to speak with others in this
						world." The gentleman looks toward Madeline almost disapproving of the fact
						that you had been chosen for such a delicate task, then walks away back to
						the safe dismissively.</p>
					<p>Madeline replied "Yes, you are correct that I said this, but it is a bit of
						a misunderstanding. There are some that we have the ability to suggest to,
						but few that we actually have the ability to talk with as we do with you.
						David is a very sensitive vessel and can be useful for our purposes in a
						less direct approach. We were not able to successfully persuade him to come
						down here, and we tried several times. His strengths are in other tasks."</p>
					<p>"Vessel you say?" you reply. "What exactly do you mean by 'vessel'?"
						Standing over by the safe the gentleman looks over and decides to approach.
						"Kind Sir," he says "Unfortunately I do not think this is the right place or
						time to have this conversation. Our window of opportunity is now open and
						we've been waiting for this window for some generations. Lets exchange the
						papers as soon as time permits if you mind." His words are delicate but his
						demeanor indicates urgency. Several lives will be released from bondage that
						ties them to this infernal ship when these papers are delivered. This is not
						just about you or your missing friend." Harshly he emphasizes "f r i e n d."
						This irks you somehow rather strongly.</p>
					<p>You look over to Madeline questioningly and say "I have more questions, and
						remember that we have a deal on this. You mentioned information leading to
						my 'f r i e n d', and that is what I expect to receive." You then abruptly
						close the folder and look eye to eye with both specters, a second later they
						both vanish and the blue flame reappears.</p>
					<p>You follow the blue flame back through the vent shafts. The air immediately
						jumps well above 100 degrees as you exit the shaft taking a bit of breath
						from your lungs. You move back through the mechanical super complex out of
						the engine room and back into the white corridors of the crew area. The
						flame helps you duck a couple of close calls with crew members and you
						proceed back to the passenger area and eventually into your cabin.</p>
					<p>A long journey to say the least but finally you've returned to your cabin
						and jump in the shower and dawn a new outfit. The sweat marks of you shirt
						make you wonder how anyone, especially the crew, is able to work in such hot
						and loud conditions month after month. You gain a bit of respect for the
						workers behind the scenes who seem to make life but a dream for the
						passengers on board.</p>
					<p>Placing the documents on the bed you pull out a camera. Systematically you
						take pictures, one by one, of all the documents recovered. There are about
						thirty pictures in all which you quickly upload to your computer. Using your
						satellite data up-link you sit by the window and upload all thirty images to
						a remote server far away in a location that no one, not even Bernard, would
						know to look for them.</p>
					<p>Once the files are finished uploading you dispatch an email to a friend
						telling him the location of the files, but nothing more. Just for good
						measure you figure. Insurance in the event that someone tries to erase this
						truth again as they did in the past. Somehow it makes you feel a little more
						secure knowing that your friend will know what to do with these documents if
						you end up missing.</p>

					<p>You remind yourself that Sarah is still missing. This apparition called you
						down here for a reason, and that reason is right in front of your face.</p>
					<p>The door stands in front of you and terrifies you.</p>
					<p>The coldness of the hallway seems to be increasing. You can almost see your
						breath. "Something is tainted here" you think to yourself. Yet you and
						Bernard have failed to find your friend Sarah, and if you don't gather as
						much information on this ship while you can, the odds are that you may never
						see her again.</p>
					<p>You put your hand on the door handle and turn it to push the door open.
						Standing back you glance in, a single light shines toward the back of the
						room and you see in plain sight a large staircase front and center. The room
						is large enough to prevent you from making out its lines from the single
						light in the center.</p>
					<p>Moving forward is difficult, your body seems to make every effort to resist,
						but your brain wants to see this through. Surprisingly with every step you
						brain moves back to the memory of the man in the hallway, judging him to
						predict what you might find, but oh so superficially. Helping an older man
						in need is hardly something to wager a person against, but for some reason
						it matters right here and now. "He was a good person," you tell yourself and
						feel a bit of warmth return to your hands. You enter the room and search for
						light switches on the inner wall, finding them you start switching them on.
						Nothing happens, but somehow this doesn't surprise you.</p>
					<p>Moving toward the center of the room your eyes start to adjust a bit. You
						can make out the high ceiling of the room and the wide rounded staircase
						leading to the second story. A green glow seems to hover against the upper
						walls as if the reflection from a pool were painting patterns on the walls.
						But, of course, there is no pool in this room. On seeing the reflections on
						the wall you finally give into the new world that you have stepped into.</p>
					<p>A shape starts to form descending from the top level of the staircase. A
						stately woman takes form in the limited light of the room. You look back
						around and notice that the door to the area has closed behind you. The woman
						has a very proper and upright posture that can only be the result of years
						of practiced restraint.</p>
					<p>"I've noticed you on my ship Mr. Neff. We've been following your progress.
						Have you found your lovely Sarah yet?" Her movements are stiff, but still
						human. Her voice is that of a school teacher from Britain.</p>
					<p>"No" you answer simply trying to gauge where you stand with this ghostly
						figure who seems to think that she owns the QE2.</p>
					<p>"Well then, we may have something that we can offer one another then. My
						name is Madeline, as you know I am not from your world but from a world long
						past. Life is but a river that the living do not notice, but us (the
						departed) have to be very fast to keep up with your world. My time here is
						limited by my strength which has limits even more so in the after life.
						Therefore lets get to business quickly."</p>
					<p>You detect flaws in her voice, very inhuman tones. As she descends the
						staircase you realize that her entire body is wavering such as the water
						like patterns on the wall. You start to realize what she is referring to.
						She seems calm but barely able to present herself this way. As she reached
						the landing halfway up the staircase she stops.</p>
					<p>The tone of the conversation starts to warm your limbs. This woman seems to
						have some very controlled desperation about her and needs your assistants,
						but why just give the information to a stranger you wonder. "Why me?" you
						question Madeline. "It is not our choice Mr. Neff. Did you ever wonder why
						you chose to do what you do, why you've dabbled in paranormal
						investigations. You have a gift that bridges the dimensions, yet it is still
						painfully difficult to reach you, but impossible for us to reach most
						people. Therefore you have been selected for this assignment in our time of
						need."</p>
					<p>"Time of need?" you question. "What time of need are you referring to? I
						thought your kind lived outside of these worries." Madeline replies "You are
						correct, but only partially. We are bound to the objects of your world like
						a compass is bound to the magnet poles of the planet. Things are
						changing..." her voice wavers, her forms moves into a disturbingly
						exaggerated shape, then she seems to force herself back to her womanly form.
						"Most of my kind can only communicate to you in strong visions from their
						own past, they are limited to only those core moments of their own life. I
						have a rather unusual gift myself, this makes our conversation possible for
						the moment."</p>
					<p>Madeline continues "Those like myself are the victims of this ship, but it
						is a double edged sword in that it is our only connection with life.
						Although true death is desirable for some of us, others such as myself wish
						to live, so we are vested in the world of the living for good or bad.
						Unfortunately we see bad things on the horizon. A great force still in the
						world of the living wishes to silence us, and possesses the power to do such
						a thing, so we are scrambling to save the lives we already failed to save
						before."</p>
					<p>"The ghosts are returning to the ship because a wrong was committed here. If
						this wrong isn't corrected than we will not make it from this place to our
						rightful resting spots at the dimensions end. So I stand her before you
						asking for your assistance." Madeline says.</p>
					<p>"What exactly has to be done?" you ask.</p>
					<p>"Our meddling with your world are of limited form. We need you to get
						something for us. There are documents on this ship that some have forgotten
						existed. These documents reside in a safe and we spirits do not have the
						focus necessary to open it, and all attempts to communicate it's existence
						with the your world have failed, until now that is." Madeline says. "These
						documents hold the truth of the dealings that took place here. The brutal
						lies that lead to war and power struggles throughout the world. When you
						retrieve the document we can broadcast them to the world, and we ghosts will
						fulfill our obligations and can move on. Otherwise we are tied to the fate
						of this ship for eternity." Madeline says.</p>
					<p>You reply "So there are documents in a safe on this ship that you'd like me
						to recover. What is so special about them?"</p>
					<p>"The documents in the safe are the greatest form of incrimination, above all
						there is a contract signed by those that once controlled much of the world's
						oil supply. These players converged on this ship to hijack the world's oil.
						Their infinite power was not enough for them, they needed even more and they
						found more by holding the planet's energy hostage. They made a deal which
						eventually lead the world to the brink of destruction for their evil
						purposes. This injustice needs to be revealed!" Madeline exclaims.</p>
					<p>"Where is the safe." You reply.</p>
					<p>"It is forgotten far in the depths of this floating relic, and was entombed
						by carelessness when construction on this ship replaced key sections of the
						engine room long ago. We have found a way that one of the living can travel
						to reach it. In exchange we have information that may help you possibly find
						Sarah. Our vision into your world is limited, but we may be able to assist.
						Please do not refuse our plea as it is difficult for us to reach your world.
						My time is drawing to an end here and I must leave. Goodbye Mr. Neff.
						Unfortunately our eternity may be in your hands. If you decide to help us
						you only need to dial #999 on your cabin phone, that is all." With that
						Madeline's form is unable to maintain it's composure and mutates into
						abstract shapes before dissolving into a green fog.</p>

					<p>You answer that she works for a well known book publishing company as a

					<p>Gathering up all the nerve you can muster you channel your confidence toward
						Farse. For a brief second you had visions that your were a Pharaoh of some
						sort and you were directing your slaves to build a pyramid. For some reason
						Detective Farse didn't seem to agree though.</p>
					<p>In fact he quickly hurdled the desk and pushed you face down on the floor.
						You meager martial arts training hadn't prepared you for this. Yes you have
						a black belt in Taekwondo, but Farse seems to have significant experience in
						detaining threats on a daily basis which seems to trump you manly pastime
						hobby.</p>
					<p>He pulls the cuffs from his back pocket and slaps them around your wrist.
						Your wrists had a bruise for a week as a result.</p>
					<p>At this point you decide to play the quiet role, and say nothing, much like
						a dog that you grab by the scruff of the neck. Farse escorts you to the
						Brigg, and locks the cage door saying not a word.</p>
					<p>You gather just a sliver of courage and say "I want to talk to my lawyer."
						To that Farse says "Well next time I see a pay phone I'll let you know. We
						are out at sea if you haven't noticed, and I am not required to pipe your
						crap through my satellite phone, so sit there and think about your actions
						for once!"</p>
					<p>Three days have passed and you're still in the cell. Bernard heard that you
						were arrested but wouldn't touch your situation with a 10 foot pole. Nothing
						has been accomplished, and your closes college is possibly dead.</p>
					<p>When the boat finally docks in Turkey you are removed from the ship and
						given a first class airline ticket back to your home state. Of course the
						Turkish authorities make absolutely sure that you make it on board the
						plane.</p>
					<p>You get home to a letter in the mailbox. A single letter inside of an
						overnight express mail package. It reads "To Mr. Travis Neff, you are hereby
						notified that you are officially a suspect in an ongoing investigation into
						the disappearance of Sarah Neff. Local authorities in your area have been
						notified of the situation. As the facts unfold in this case we will notify
						you further." The letter continues on but you just can't bring yourself to
						read further.</p>
					<p>The years pass by and you realize that Sarah was much more than a coworker,
						she was a friend, she was even a love at different points. The greatest pain
						in your life happened that night on the ship, and unfortunately you will
						never forgive yourself. THE END.</p>

					<p>This Farse character seems pretty swift. You wonder if he's really as good
						as he seems to be. After all, he is the chief security officer on the QE.</p>
					<p>You decide to tell him the truth, but casually leave out the part about
						being private investigators. You tell Farse that you and Sarah had met a man
						in the hallway while traveling on the boat. His name is Bernard. You and
						Bernard have much in common and you strolled over to his room to talk with
						him.</p>
					<p>Farse seems to buy the story and casually asks "What are your interests in
						common?". You mention your common interest in photography as the most
						noticeable similarity (of course leaving out the part about using
						photography for investigate people). Farse nods his head, he seems to like
						the topic. You wonder if Farse is an avid photographer himself.</p>
					<p>The conversation goes on for a couple of minutes and then Farse motions that
						he really should be moving on to other things.</p>
					<p>You rise from the chair and leave the room. In the back of your mind you
						make a mental note to tell Bernard about the encounter with Farse in order
						to get your stories together. It is very possible that Farse could knock on
						Bernard's door and he wouldn't have a clue what to say.</p>
					<p>As you're leaving Farse says one last thing. "Please be accessible."</p>

					<p>Sure security cameras on the ship might show that your wrong, but Farse and
						you both know that if he tracks the security footage to see if you were

					<p>Farse is frustrated to say the least, and he decides to end the conversation

						my office with excuses that amount to little or nothing. I highly suggest
						you get yourself together and soon. Get out Mr. Neff, and if I find you

					<p>Farse meets you eyes and seem to slowly be turning bloodshot. Then he brakes

					<p>You decide to tell Detective Farse that you went up to the casino for

					<p>Farse senses something amiss with your response. He momentarily has a
						mischievous look on this face and says. "Understandable, you decided to go
						gamble at the casino. Your passenger card should have that information so
						I'll just pull it up here". He turns back to his computer and draws up your
						passenger file. He pauses and says "Well Mr. Neff it shows that you made a
						$5 purchase with you passenger card between the auction and now. Is that
						correct? There must be something wrong with our system".</p>
					<p>You realize that you just got caught in a lie. You forgot that Farse has
						access to all of your financial transactions on the ship as no cashier on
						the ship accepts anything but your passenger card for purchases. The
						passenger is much like a credit card except you have to pay it off at the
						end of the journey.</p>
					<p>You quickly change your story and tell him that you were just watching. You
						get the feeling that he is disgusted with your presence. Farse says "So, you
						entered the casino for a couple of hours and did nothing but watch other
						people gamble. Mr. Neff, we're having a communication issue here. If you
						can't be honest with me then this isn't going to work. I am an officer on
						this ship, and I am responsible for the security of this vessel. Please
						respect my time!"</p>
					<p>You feel a bit of anger growing in your chest. This man thinks he can just

					<p>You decide to pass on the information to Farse and tell him every detail
						about the incident in hopes that he might be able to help you find Sarah.
						Even though you know that opening up yourself to this kind of inquiry might
						blow your cover if you don't watch your words very carefully, the fear of
						not seeing Sarah again makes your mouth jump into action and tell him
						everything about the auction.</p>
					<p>You and Sarah had lived with each other on several different occasions, all
						for the job of course. Now faced with the thought of not working with her or
						even casually talking with her again, it's too much to take for this job or
						any job. You want to tell Farse the truth about your false identities, but
						that is a place that you can not take the conversation as it could impact
						your ability to try and find Sarah.</p>
					<p>Farse hearing all of the gritty details of the auction mix-up starts to rub
						his temples. "So your saying that the painting may have not been yours, and
						that the painting disappeared from the room". You nod affirmative. Farse
						looks to the wallpaper almost for inspiration as he sits back in his chair.
						"Well, maybe she realized the issue and took the painting back to the
						auction house. But, then what..." He trails off.</p>
					<p>Farse starts to get fidgety and even a bit agitated. He starts to move his
						hands in big circles as he's talking with you. "So there is no other
						information? Your room showed no forced entry so it seems that she left of
						her own accord." He pauses a couple of seconds then says to you "I will
						personally check the auction house from top to bottom. I will also check the
						security cameras we have around the ship. I hope for you Mr. Neff that you
						are telling the truth because this case may get dirty and we may all pick up
						some mud from this." He seems to be referring to you as if he knows
						something. But what?</p>

					<p>You momentarily close your eyes and concentrate on remembering the events of
						the day. You and Sarah awoke at the regular time, got ready for the day,
						went to breakfast, then returned to the cabin to do some work.</p>
					<p>Sarah was getting a bit antsy and suggested going to the daily auction at
						noon up in the loft tower of the ship.</p>
					<p>You recall registering for the auction and strolling through the selection
						of artworks. You recall the scent of incredibly wealth amassed in the room.
						Older gentlemen with limitless pockets strolling around judging the works on
						display.</p>
					<p>The view from the loft was amazing. A 360 degree view of the ship with
						panels of windows edged outward on the mostly rounded floor-plan. You could
						barely see the coastline off in the distance, very small on the horizon.</p>
					<p>Finally the auction started and everyone took their seats. Some of the
						painting were quick to bid up in value. Others took a bit of coxing by the
						auctioneer. One such of these slow to start painting caught your attention.
						It was a painting of a hay field in the summertime. Golden rolls of hay on
						the landscape with trees sprinkled here and there. It reminded you a bit of
						your grandfathers cottage you used to visit while on summer vacation as a
						kid. Wonderful memories of long days and pleasant evenings learning life at
						a slower pace than what you were used to in Cleavland as a kid.</p>
					<p>You recall Sarah's look of excitement as the auctioneer says "Sold!" and
						Sarah and you move to the back of the room to purchase the painting. It was
						a bit small for a painting and didn't set you back much. As the payment was
						finalized the cashier tells you to take a seat for a couple of moments while
						they wrap the painting for you, which you both do happily.</p>
					<p>Farse brings you back to the moment by asking you if there is anything today
						that seemed a little out of place. Someone you had a strange interaction
						with. Something that didn't quite go as planned. Maybe a message that didn't
						make sense.</p>
					<p>Without thinking you mention that you and "Trisha" attended an auction, and
						you purchased a painting.</p>
					<p>Detective Farse taps his pencil on the desk as coxes you for more
						information. He says "So there was a painting. Was it an expensive
						painting?". You tell him no. He says "Where is the painting now."</p>
					<p>With that you snap completely back to the present. Farse notices this to.
						Where is the painting? The painting is gone! Possibly with Sarah! Maybe
						these were common thieves that broke into the cabin while Sarah was there
						and took her and the painting.</p>
					<p>Then a revelation. You recall the small size of the painting, yet the
						painting that was given to you by the cashier barely fit under your shoulder
						as you walked back to the cabin. Sure the painting was wrapped in butcher
						paper, but the dimensions of the painting still didn't match the dimensions
						of the painting that you remembered buying at the auction. "Could they have
						given me the wrong painting by mistake?" you wonder to yourself.</p>

					<p>Once again you struggle to find an exit to this question. You counter with a
						question of your own "Detective Farse, exactly what might that have to do
						with anything right at this moment? I'm really tired and I'd like to
						concentrate on finding her now and filling out your form later".</p>
					<p>Farse understands what this is, a diversion. He knows that you don't know.
						"Strike Two!" your subconscious shouts out. He casually says "Mr. Neff if
						your wife is not missing but instead was abducted then it may be an
						important issue. We can figure out these details later so lets move on". You

					<p>Farse signals to David that it is time to wrap up the conversation. He says
						that he'll be in touch later.</p>
					<p>He puts out a hand to shake. You introduce yourself as Travis Neff. He
						responds with "Detective Raymond Farse" and motions to a seat in front of
						his desk.</p>
					<p>Farse says "Mr. Neff, thank you for coming down here on such short notice.
						On behalf of myself I want to apologize for the inconvenience and we will do
						absolutely everything we can to help find your wife".</p>
					<p>He starts to ask you questions about your wife "Trisha". The words Tri-sha
						seem to roll off of his tongue like a slow moving freight train, and your
						shoelace is stuck in the rail. "This could turn out really bad" is the
						thought that passes through your head.</p>
					<p>Your real name isn't Travis, you and Sarah aren't married, you are private
						investigators traveling under aliases. passports, id badges, credit cards,
						and any other form of identification for that matter can be manufactured if
						you know the right people, and you definitely know the right people. What
						bothers you right this second is that you can't seem to remember some of the
						specifics of Sarah's alias. And to make matters worse your in a chair in
						front of the security officer who's investigating the disappearance of your
						"wife" while on a cruise ship in international waters.</p>
					<p>The international waters part is a rather important piece of information. It
						basically means that to some extent you operate outside of the boundaries of
						any country. The rules become vague, which gives Farse the upper hand.</p>
					<p>The next sentence that comes out of Farse's mouth is "Trisha's complete
						name". Damn, what was her middle name... You can't remember and start
						fumbling through your pockets for your cell phone. It doesn't work here on
						the ship, but it has notes about her personal information (such as her
						middle name). Your cell phone is nowhere to be found. Damn!</p>
					<p>Farse watches you fumble for a device that is no longer there. He analyzes
						you as you try and recall just exactly what her middle name was. You
						struggle for an answer and can hear the wall clock ticking in the
						background. The room is silent. You start to speak...</p>
					<p>"It's been a very long and stressful day. My brain isn't quite firing
						correctly." Farse says, "So you can't remember your wife's middle name?" You
						reply with a slight studded "Uh, honestly I can't remember right this
						second. My brain is completely toast for the moment."</p>
					<p>Farse then asks "Toast? Are you on some sort of medication?" You realize
						that Farse isn't going to back down from this point. After all, he has a
						point. A husband should know his wife's middle name, all the time, no matter

					<p>You desperately search for a way to change the topic and say "No I'm not
						taking any medication and I have all that information written down in my
						cabin. On a good day I'm not very good with names. Can we do this tomorrow?"
						Farse looks at you in the eye and you can tell that he's lost some respect
						for you. "Well Mr. Neff, that information may already be in the computer.
						Let me check." He turns to his computer and punches up a couple keys. After
						a minute or two he has the information about you two.</p>
					<p>Farse says "Trisha Dolores Neff, born Dec 12th 1970. That was easy, sorry to
						tax your brain with minute details after your difficult day." You definitely
						catch a bit of sarcasm in his voice.</p>
					<p>"Can I ask you one more personal question, just so we can wrap up this
						person missing form tonight?" Farse says. You hesitantly answer "Yes".
						"Where does your wife work?"</p>

					<p>You decide to go and talk with Detective Farse. The Security Room is quite a
						distance from your room towards the bow (front) of the ship. You're not very
						familiar with the ship, but fortunately there are maps posted along the way
						complete with little round symbols showing exactly where you are.</p>
					<p>You round a corner expecting to see an elevator leading you down to deck
						level 2A (where the Security Room is), instead you get the feeling that
						you've entered a part of the ship that is rarely used by passengers. The
						carpeting is less new, noticeable blemishes appear on the walls. Given the
						age of the ship this is completely expected, but it is clearly visible that
						the someone in charge of the maintenance of the ship has decided that this
						area is less important than the passenger facing areas. Almost imperceptibly
						but importantly you realize that this ship and any passenger ship for that
						matter may appear to be a majestic floating castle, but deep down it is real
						machinery run by real people who must make decisions about who to best
						maintain it.</p>
					<p>The elevator doors slide open and you walk in. Unlike the main lobby
						elevators this elevator has very few adornments, in fact it looks no
						different that any elevator in any average building anywhere. The facade
						presented to the passengers of an almost godly standard of living is just
						that, and the nuts and bolts of the ship are no more than necessary in any
						ship of this magnitude.</p>
					<p>The doors slide open at level 2A, why there is a 2A and a 2B may have
						something to do with the ceiling height. The ceilings are noticeably shorter
						than those in the passenger areas. In fact, if you are taller than 6 feet
						you may have an issue. A map shows you the final path that must be taken to
						get to the Security Room. Just round the corner and head down the hall and
						you're there. The surrounding have changed dramatically, down here there are
						no carpeted floors, or hand railing, the roof feels like it is collapsing
						in, the air is a bit stuffy. Wires run through the upper corners of the
						hallway, down the length of the corridor, and wrap to the right around a
						corner. Heavy doors line the hallway and require you to step over their
						lower borders. These doors are meant to hold against water, you know that
						you are getting closer to the truth of this ship.</p>
					<p>As you approach a somewhat nondescript room with a placard in big and exact
						letters reaffirming "Security", you hear a noise coming from inside. The
						space is dimly lit and you see not a soul as you look from one side to
						another down the length of the corridor. The words coming out of the room
						are floating on the air through the crack and down to your vantage point.</p>

					<p>You take this opportunity to head over to the small supply shop over in the
						merchant area of the ship, by the main lobby. Picking up some common
						supplies you turn to leave, but a man approaches you blocking your way. "Mr.
						Neff?" the man says and you nod agreeably to his question. He then says "Can
						I talk with you?" in a rather insistent manner. You feel like you have no
						choice as the man doesn't seem to be allowing you to step away from the
						conversation.</p>
					<p>After an awkward pause you say "Sure, how can I help you?" You both stroll
						over to the corridor and start to walk slowly. The man says "My name is
						Raymond Farse. I am the chief security officer on this ship."</p>
					<p>As you move down the hallway you realize that this is the guy that wrote the

					<p>The Security Room is quite a distance from your current location, towards
						the bow (front) of the ship. You round a corner and get the feeling that

					<p>The doors slide open at level 2A. "Why is there a 2A and a 2B" you casually

					<p>You answer that she works for a well known book publishing company as a

					<p>Farse looks you in the eye and seems somewhat satisfied with the answer. He

					<p>Gathering up all the nerve you can muster you channel your confidence toward
						Farse. For a brief second you have visions that your are a Pharaoh of some
						sort and you were directing your slaves to build a pyramid. For some reason
						Detective Farse didn't seem to agree though.</p>
					<p>In fact he quickly hurdles over the desk and pushed you face down on the
						floor. Your meager martial arts training hadn't prepared you for this
						powerful of an attach. Yes you have a black belt in Taekwondo, but Farse
						seems to have significant experience in detaining threats on a daily basis
						which seems to trump you manly pastime experience.</p>
					<p>He pulls the cuffs from his back pocket and slaps them around your wrist.
						Your wrists quickly form a bluish bruise as a result.</p>
					<p>At this point you decide to play the quiet role, and say nothing, much like
						a cat that has been grabbed by the scruff of the neck. Farse escorts you to
						the brig, and locks the cell door saying not a word.</p>
					<p>You gather just a sliver of courage and say "I want to talk to my lawyer."
						To this Farse says "Well next time I see a pay phone I'll let you know. We
						are out at sea if you haven't noticed, and I am not required to pipe your
						crap through my satellite phone, so sit there and think about your actions!"</p>
					<p>Three days have passed and you're still in the cell. Bernard heard that you
						are arrested but wouldn't touch your situation with a 10 foot pole. Nothing
						has been accomplished, and your closes college is possibly dead.</p>
					<p>When the boat finally docks in Turkey you are removed from the ship,
						interrogated by the local authorities, and given a first class airline
						ticket back to your home state. Of course the Turkish authorities make
						absolutely sure that you make it on board the plane.</p>
					<p>You get home to a letter in the mailbox. A single letter inside of an
						overnight express mail package. It reads "To Mr. Travis Neff, you are hereby
						notified that you are officially a suspect in an ongoing investigation into
						the disappearance of Trisha Neff. Local authorities in your area have been
						notified of the situation. As the facts unfold in this case we will notify
						you further." The letter continues on but you just can't bring yourself to
						read further.</p>
					<p>The years pass by and you realize that Sarah was much more than a coworker,
						she was a friend, she was even a love at different points. The greatest pain
						in your life happened that night on the ship, and unfortunately you will
						never forgive yourself. THE END.</p>

					<p>This Farse character seems pretty sharp. You wonder if he's really as good
						at what he does as he seems to be. After all he is the chief security
						officer on the QE2 no less.</p>
					<p>You decide to basically tell him the truth, but leave out the part about
						being a private investigators. You tell Farse that you and Trisha had met a
						man in the hallway while traveling on the boat. His name is "Greg"
						(Bernard's name for this journey).</p>
					<p>The story went like this, you and Greg Sherman have much in common so you
						strolled over to his room to talk with him.</p>
					<p>Farse seems to buy the story and causally asks "What are your interests in
						common?". You mention your common interest in photography as the most

					<p>Sure security cameras on the ship might show that you're wrong, but Farse

					<p>Farse is frustrated to say the least, and he decides to end the conversation

					<p>Farse meets you eyes and seem to slowly be turning bloodshot. He then brakes

					<p>You decide to tell Detective Farse that you went up to the casino for

					<p>You get the feeling that Farse senses something amiss with your response. He

						you decided to go gamble at the casino. Your passenger card should have that
						information so I'll just pull it up here". He turns back to his computer and
						draws up your passenger file. He pauses and says "Well Mr. Neff it shows
						that you made a $5 purchase with you passenger card between the auction and
						now. Is that correct? There must be something wrong with our system".</p>
					<p>You realize that you just got caught in a lie. You forgot that Farse has
						access to all of your financial transactions on the ship as no cashier on
						the ship accepts anything but your passenger card for purchases. The
						passenger card is much like a credit card except you have to pay it off at
						the end of the journey.</p>
					<p>You quickly change your story and tell him that you were just watching. You
						get the feeling that he seems disgusted with your presence. Farse says "So,

						people gamble?" A long awkward pause ensues. "Mr. Neff, we're having a
						communication issue here. If you can't be honest with me then this isn't
						going to work. I am an officer on this ship, and I am responsible for the
						security of this vessel. On top of that I'm trying to find YOUR WIFE! Please
						respect my time."</p>

					<p>You decide to pass on the information to Farse and tell him every detail
						about the incident in hopes that he might be able to help you find Sarah.
						Even though you know that opening up yourself to this kind of inquiry might
						blow your cover if you don't watch your words very carefully, the fear of
						not seeing Sarah again makes your mouth jump into action and tell him
						everything about the auction.</p>
					<p>You and Sarah had lived with each other on several different occasions, all

						that is a place that you can not take the conversation as it could impact
						your ability to try and find Sarah.</p>
					<p>Farse hearing all of the details of the auction mix-up starts to rub his
						temples. "So your saying that the painting may have not been yours, and that
						the painting disappeared from the room". You nod affirmative. Farse looks to
						the wallpaper almost for inspiration as he sits back in his chair. "Well,
						maybe she realized the issue and took the painting back to the auction
						house. But, then what..." He trails off.</p>
					<p>Farse starts to get fidgety and even a bit agitated. He starts to move his
						hands in big circles as he's talking with you. "So there is no other
						information? Your room showed no forced entry so it seems that she left of
						her own accord." He pauses a couple of seconds then says to you "I will
						personally check the auction house from top to bottom. I will also check the
						security cameras we have around the ship. I hope for you Mr. Neff that you
						are telling the truth because this case may get dirty and we may all pick up
						some mud from this." He seems to be referring to you as if he knows

					<p>You momentarily close your eyes and concentrate on remembering the events of
						the day. You and Sarah awoke at the regular time, got ready for the day,
						went to breakfast, then returned to the cabin to do some work.</p>
					<p>Sarah was getting a bit antsy and suggested going to the daily auction at
						noon up in the loft tower of the ship.</p>
					<p>You recall registering for the auction and strolling through the selection
						of artworks. You recall the scent of incredible wealth amassed in the room.
						Older gentlemen with limitless pockets strolling around judging the works on
						display.</p>
					<p>The view from the loft was amazing. A 360 degree view of the ship with
						panels of windows edged outward on the mostly rounded floor-plan. You could
						barely see the coastline off in the distance, very small on the horizon.</p>
					<p>Finally the auction started and everyone took their seats. Some of the
						painting were quick to bid up in value. Others took a bit of coxing by the
						auctioneer. One such slow to start painting caught your attention. It was a
						painting of a hay field in the summertime. Golden rolls of hay on the
						landscape with trees sprinkled here and there. It reminded you a bit of your
						grandfathers cottage were you used to visit while on summer vacation as a
						kid. Wonderful memories of long days and pleasant evenings learning life at
						a slower pace than what you were used to in Cleveland as a kid.</p>
					<p>You recall Sarah's look of excitement as the auctioneer says "Sold!" and you
						both move to the back of the room to purchase the painting. It was a bit
						small for a painting and didn't set you back too much. As the payment was
						finalized the cashier tells you to take a seat for a couple of moments while
						they wrap the painting for you, which you both do happily.</p>
					<p>Farse snaps you out of the vision asking you if there is anything today that
						seemed a little out of place. Someone you had a strange interaction with.
						Something that didn't quite go as planned. Maybe a message that didn't make
						sense.</p>
					<p>Without thinking you mention that you and "Trisha" attended an auction, and
						you purchased a painting.</p>
					<p>Detective Farse taps his pencil on the desk as if prodding for more
						information. He says "So there was a painting. Was it an expensive
						painting?". You tell him no. He says "Where is the painting now."</p>
					<p>With that you snap completely back to the present. Farse notices this to.
						Where is the painting? The painting is gone! Possibly with Sarah! Maybe
						these were common thieves that broke into the cabin while Sarah was there
						and took her and the painting.</p>
					<p>Then a revelation. You recall the small size of the painting, yet the
						painting that was given to you by the cashier barely fit under your solder
						as you walked back to the cabin. Sure the painting was wrapped in butcher
						paper, but the dimensions of the painting still didn't match the dimensions
						of the painting that you remembered buying at the auction. "Could they have
						given me the wrong painting by mistake?" you wonder to yourself.</p>

						now and filling out forms later".</p>
					<p>Farse understands what this is, a diversion. He knows that you don't know.
						"Strike Two!" you subconscious think to yourself. He casually says "You're

					<p>Farse says "Mr. Neff, I want you to know that we will do absolutely
						everything we can to help find your wife". He starts to ask you questions
						about your wife "Trisha". The words Tri-sha seem to roll off of his tongue
						like a slow moving freight train, with your shoelace is stuck in the rail.
						"This could turn out really bad" is the thought that passes through your
						head.</p>
					<p>Your real name isn't Travis, you and Sarah aren't married, you are private
						investigators traveling under aliases. passports, id badges, credit cards,
						and any other form of identification for that matter can be manufactured if
						you know the right people, and you definitely know the right people. What
						bothers you right this second is that you can't seem to remember some of the
						specifics of Sarah's (aka Trisha Neff's) bio. And to make matters worse your
						in a chair in front of the security officer who's investigating the
						disappearance of your "wife" while on a cruise ship in international waters.</p>
					<p>The international waters part is a rather important piece of information. It
						basically means that to some extent you operate outside of the boundaries of
						any country. The rules become vague, which gives Farse the upper hand.</p>
					<p>The next sentence that comes out of Farse's mouth is "Trisha's complete
						name". Damn, what was her middle name... You can't remember and start
						fumbling through your pockets for your cell phone. It doesn't work here on
						the ship, but it has notes about her personal information (such as her
						middle name). Your cell phone is nowhere to be found. Damn!</p>
					<p>Farse watches you fumble for a device that is no longer there. He analyses
						you as you try and recall just exactly what her middle name was. You
						struggle for an answer and can hear the wall clock ticking in the
						background. The room is silent. You start to speak...</p>
					<p>"It's been a very long and stressful journey. My brain isn't quite firing
						correctly."</p>
					<p>Farse says, "So you can't remember your wife's middle name?" You reply with
						a slight studded "Uh, honestly I can't remember right this second. My brain
						is complete nonsense for the moment."</p>
					<p>Farse then asks "Nonsense? Are you on some sort of medication?" You realize
						that Farse isn't going to back down from this point. After all, he has a
						point. A husband should know his wife's middle name, all the time, no matter
						what, especially if they've been married for 11 years.</p>
					<p>You desperately search for a way to change the topic and say "No I'm not
						taking any medication and I have all of this information written down in my
						cabin. On a good day I'm not very good with names. Can we do this tomorrow?"</p>
					<p>Farse looks at you. in his eyes and you can tell that he's lost some respect
						for you. "Well Mr. Neff, that information may already be in the computer.
						Let me check." He turns to his computer and punches up a couple keys. After
						a minute or two he has the information about you two.</p>
					<p>Farse says "Trisha Dolores Neff, born Dec 12th 1970. That was easy, sorry to
						tax your brain with minute details after your difficult day." You definitely
						catch a bit of sarcasm in his voice.</p>
					<p>"Can I ask you one more personal question, just so we can wrap up this
						person missing report today?" Farse says. You hesitantly answer "Yes".
						"Where does your wife work?"</p>

					<p>Swallowing a gulp in your throat you tell him that you did receive the note.
						Farse looks at you a little disturbed and asks "Were the directions not
						explicit enough, or did you have more important things to do than help me
						find your wife?"</p>
					<p>You decide not to answer the question as it is so loaded that nothing you
						say could get you out of this direct confrontation. The air is stale with
						silence. Both you and Farse are most definitely not on good terms, and it is
						very much out in the open.</p>

					<p>With the amount of paperwork on Farse's desk you can't help but get the

					<p>Deciding not to make waves at the moment you casually state that you had not
						received the message. To this Farse gives you a quick look over as if he's
						about to say something, but then pauses. It's obvious that he'll find out
						the truth for himself so your lie will only smooth things over for awhile.</p>

					<p>You stroll into the casino and head straight back to the Cashier's cage. A
						beautiful girl around your age is working the counter today. You trade
						glances, then remember that you've come here with a purpose.</p>
					<p>"May I speak with Manny?" You ask. "I'll go get him," she replies and
						disappears behind the back door of the room. Soon she comes back out and
						mentions that he is busy at the moment. She finishes the statement with: "He
						told me to tell you good luck."</p>
					<p>Manny meant "Farewell" in a slightly lighter tone is what you figure. You
						realize that you can't leave on this note. Manny is one of the few people on
						the ship who can help you find Sarah. You ask the women "Can I please talk
						with him for just a second." She looks at you as if used to the change of
						personality sometimes exhibited by people on the outside of this cage. "He
						is busy" she says, sternly. You take the hint and leave the cashier line.</p>
					<p>You casually stroll back out of the casino, realizing how fragile
						relationships can be when first impressions go wrong. "How can someone offer
						up help, and so easily retract it?" you think to yourself. In the back of
						your mind the true answer is that "he didn't owe you anything, and he
						offered to do you a favor." You make it a point to tell yourself to learn

					<p>As the elevator approaches the Litto deck you can see out across the hallway
						and the enclosing glass doors leading outside. The night is breezy, you can
						see the stringers of national flags leading from some unknown origin to the
						single aerodynamic smokestack of the ship. Powerful lights beam down into
						the pool and lounging areas below. No one appears to be out there, and
						rightfully so considering the weather.</p>
					<p>You exit the elevator and get your jacket ready as you begin to go outside.
						"Why in gods name would Manny want to meet hear?" being the security officer
						on the ship you guess that there is a reason. Maybe something to do with the
						fact that it would be near impossible to record a conversation with the
						nightly winds on the outside decks.</p>
					<p>The glass walls of the hallway give a spectacular view looking down the
						length of the ship. The flood lights pointing up the smokestack make you
						realize that every inch of these passenger-facing areas are designed with
						the goal to make you dream of a life bigger that ever. As you exit the doors
						the wind quickly grips your clothes and you have to fight a bit to stay
						moving straight.</p>
					<p>You move out into the center of the deck area, but no one appears to be
						there. Looking down at your watch you realize that you missed the meeting,
						but still hoping to find Manny you walk around for a couple more minutes
						searching for any sign of him.</p>
					<p>Finally the biting wind convinces you to walk back inside. You turn around
						and head straight back into the ship. Your hands are freezing and you gladly
						invite the warm air of a floor vent to heat them up. You get the feeling
						that you may have missed your opportunity to talk with Manny. He didn't seem
						like the kind of person to keep waiting, and now you are sure of it.</p>

						little sideways.</p>
					<p>"Look Travis you may think that you can travel the world and pretend your
						someone else. But, the truth is that not everyone is a fool, and many people
						have access to the truth about many things that you may not want them to
						have access to. This is the game of life we all participate in so get used
						to it."</p>
					<p>A bit harsh for an introduction you think. He's espousing slogans like
						you're some sort of child. You realize that in order for this man to be of
						use to you he has to be handled very carefully. He already knows your real
						name, and god knows what else. He can easily have you arrested. It seems
						like the cards are in his hand.</p>

					<p>As the elevator approaches the Litto deck you can see out across the hallway
						to the enclosing glass doors leading outside. The night is breezy, the
						stringers spanning from the bow to the stern of the ship have hundreds of
						national flags. You can see one such stringer leading to the single
						aerodynamic smokestack of the ship. Powerful lights beam down into the pool
						and lounging area below. No one is out there except for a single man bundled
						up in a long coat trying to stay out of the fierce winds.</p>
					<p>You exit the elevator and get your jacket ready as you begin to go outside.
						"Why in God's name would Manny want to meet hear?" being the security
						officer on the ship you guess that there is a reason. Maybe something to do
						with the fact that it would be near impossible to record a conversation with
						the nightly winds on the outside decks.</p>
					<p>The glass walls of the hallway give a spectacular view looking down the
						length of the ship. The flood lights pointing up the smokestack make you
						realize that every inch of these passenger facing areas are designed with
						the goal of making you dream of a life bigger than ever. As you exit the
						doors the wind quickly grips your clothes and you have to fight a bit to
						stay moving straight.</p>
					<p>Manny sees you coming, and motions for you to come over to his direction.
						"Hello Manny," you belt out loudly. He nods his head in reply and says "I
						didn't expect the wind to be this strong," but offers up no alternative to
						go somewhere else. You can barely hear him as he talks. "You work for
						Bernard?" he asks in a round-about way. You nod back.</p>
					<p>"So Mr. Soronsen how do you like the ship?" Manny asks as he peers out to
						the coastline several miles away. Your a bit stunned that he knows your real
						name. You assume that Bernard wouldn't have just told him, so why would he
						know it, and more importantly why would he use it in conversation? Is this
						some sort of joke or power play you wonder.</p>

					<p>The message that Mark left for you keeps rolling through your head. You
						wonder if you're missing an opportunity.</p>
					<p>Mark seems to have a wealth of resources on this ship, and your search for
						Sarah has turned up nothing concrete yet. Time is running short.</p>
					<p>You hold off telling Bernard about the message from Mark deciding that it's
						best if he doesn't know. You wonder if you should tell him though. Bernard
						and you are close friends, but he may not have the ability to help you find
						Sarah like Mark does. Heck maybe Mark knows where she is right now but
						pretends otherwise? Maybe he's the one responsible for her disappearance?</p>
					<p>If so then he holds all of the cards. Time is of the essence on this mission
						so there is no time to pass up opportunities.</p>
					<p>You dial Mark's cabin number on your room phone, but for some reason it
						doesn't go through. Instead you decide to walk up to his room and try this
						the old fashion way... knock.</p>
					<p>Mark opens the door and steps into the hallway closing the door behind
						himself. Odd behavior for sure, but you decide to disregard it for now.</p>
					<p>"Glad to see you Travis," Mark says. "Did you get my phone message?" You
						reply that you got the message and that you're interested in talking over
						some points.</p>
					<p>As the words come out of your mouth you realize more exactly that you are
						actively betraying Bernard's trust in you by going straight to Mark without
						his knowledge.</p>
					<p>You decide to move on with the conversation and ask Mark if there is a place
						you both can talk. Mark seems happy with your response and starts walking
						down the hallway, you follow.</p>
					<p>"Travis, we have a common goal but from different directions. We both have a
						desire to understand the supernatural. From your side it is a life's work.
						From my side it is a means to an end." His words seem sincere, and he seems
						to be openly conferring in you the scope of the problems on the QE2.
						Problems that you've witnessed first hand.</p>
					<p>"To get straight to the point Travis... I could use people like you." His
						tone strikes you as a bit odd. "People like you". It seems like he's trying
						to recruit an employee you think to yourself. Bernard would not like this
						conversation one bit.</p>
					<p>You're thoughts focus back to the reason why you decided to talk with Mark
						about his message... Sarah. "You know Mark, I would be interested in the
						opportunity, but I need to focus on one thing right now, finding Sarah. This
						is my primary and there is no secondary responsibility. You've tried to
						help, but it hasn't turned up anything usable."</p>
					<p>Mark hears what you're saying and seems to understand your situation. He
						seems like he's hunting for a response. He seems to hesitate then says, "I
						will redouble my efforts, you will not be disappointed." This sounds like
						music to your ears, but somehow it doesn't sooth your soul. You'll have to
						think this later you tell yourself.</p>
					<p>Coming back to the conversation at hand you reply, "That sounds great."</p>
					<p>Mark says, "I would like you to be part of my team Travis. I know that you
						have great powers with your abilities to communicate past the threshold of
						this world. Money is no object here at this point. You would be well
						compensated to say the least. All I need from you is a firm commitment." You
						shrug off the offer wondering if Mark truly understands what he's talking
						about.</p>
					<p>He sounds like he understands one thing much better than most other
						things... money. He's a bean counter and sees that world through those rose
						colored glasses. Still you wonder if you're missing an opportunity.</p>
					<p>You tell Mark that you'll think over his offer, but need awhile to figure
						out if this will work. Mark catches you one final time before you finally
						part ways and head around a corner back to your cabin.</p>
					<p>"Don't think too long on this Travis. Time is running out." he says
						ominously</p>

					<p>You show up at the designated location. Shortly after you arrive Mark walks
						in the door with a tall dark haired women.</p>
					<p>"Hello Travis. I'd like to introduce you to Catherine." She shakes your hand
						firmly and to the point. "Catherine, is going to help out. She will be
						performing some of the background work for the investigation and needs
						honest and exact information from you".</p>
					<p>You answer all of her questions honestly and to the best of your ability.
						After Catherine is done with the questions she packs up her things and
						leaves the meeting.</p>
					<p>It's just you and Mark now and you feel a bit uneasy about that. He somehow
						reminds you of a shark. The realization amuses you, but makes you want to
						distance yourself as well.</p>
					<p>Mark starts asking you questions about your background. He seems to be
						interested in your paranormal experience. You go along with his questions
						but for some reason it feels like an interview. You wrap up with Mark and
						head back to your cabin.</p>

					<p>Approaching the double doors of the bridge deck Farse knocks on the glass.
						Shortly after you hear a buzzing sound and Farse opens the door. You both
						walk into the bridge room. The room is filled with instrument panels, brass
						levers, buttons, valves, and an odd combination of top of the line plush
						leather chairs. Mechanically you see a mixture of the old machines used to
						guide the ship and the new digital equipment that takes up far less space.
						The ship's wheel is a large wooden circle stained to a light oak color with
						ornamental handles capped with brass fittings.</p>
					<p>A tall gentlemen approaches you, Farse moves to talk first "Hello Captain,
						this is Travis Neff. He has something to show you." You take that as a cue
						to pull out the metal plaque you found while in the ghostly world. You
						quickly look it over one last time before handing it to the captain.</p>
					<p>Anton carefully inspects the curves of the metal plate and the rivet holes
						on the ends, then says "I can't be certain, but I'm guessing this has
						something to do with the propeller shaft. So you found this somewhere? How
						did you come by it exactly? This plate looks like it could easily be fifty
						years old."</p>
					<p>You look over to Farse hoping for a little guidance in this situation.
						"I..." you hesitate to start and continue "Lets just say that I found while
						I was down by the stage area in the conference quarters."</p>
					<p>Anton looks at you a bit puzzled. "OK, we can say that for now." He seems a
						bit concerned because your lie is so transparent. Looking over to Farse you
						get the feeling that Farse is embarrassed by your thinly veiled non-truth.
						"I'd like more answers on this, but lets move on (for now)."</p>
					<p>Farse steps into the conversation "Captain, we'd like to ask for your
						permission to visit the site that this plaque was posted to. We think it may
						be a clue in our investigation."</p>
					<p>"Investigation?" Anton says "Now we're getting somewhere. So this plate may
						indicate a place for you to look. If you go down into the engine room, I
						will insist that you be escorted. It's a dangerous area of the ship,
						anything can happen if you aren't mindful of where you are at all times. The
						propeller shaft spins at 500 rotation per minute. At 13 tons, that's a lot
						of force. Let me make a phone call." Anton steps over to a phone hanging on
						the back wall of the bridge. The phone looks antique with a porcelain
						handle. Someone in charge obviously doesn't get rid of functional equipment
						even after 70 years of use.</p>
					<p>Anton steps back over to you after talking on the phone. "I've talked with
						the chief engineer. He's sending up someone to escort you both down to the
						propeller shaft. Please don't think that you have free reign to travel down
						there. Just stick to the propeller shaft area please. It will be hot, very
						hot, so be prepared to sweat." Shortly thereafter a young ship mate enters
						the bridge and introduces himself as ensign McCarthy". You and Detective
						Farse follow him out of the bridge and into an elevator across the hallway.</p>
					<p>"This elevator will take us down to the top level of the engine area, but
						we'll have to foot it the rest of the way. Also, it gets really hot down
						there so be pr..." you reply "Prepared to sweat? Ya I heard that".</p>
					<p>You arrive at the top level of the engine area. The control panels are all
						digital. It looks more like a surveillance station that would be used in
						some military compound than you'd image a ships engine room to look like.
						McCarthy says "This is where we monitor the ship, amazingly we can operate
						the entire vessel from here with just a handful of people". You think about
						it for a second and it does strike you as amazing that a ship of this size
						can be operated with a handful of people. Amazing world we live in for sure.</p>
					<p>McCarthy funnels you down the corridors, through the dark areas and around
						the corners, down the stairways, and through the water tight doors. The heat
						starts to rise and sweat starts pouring down your body underneath your
						shirt. You hear a something big off in the distance, a roaring sound. A
						slight breeze of hot air follows the sound. McCarthy moves you and Farse
						closer to it.</p>
					<p>After descending several ladders the space gets more cramped and hotter. You
						hear moving machinery around the corner. A loud whipping sound like
						something very heavy turning very fast. A slight breeze is coming from
						around the corner. Flood lights alert you to a long spinning shaft which you
						obviously determine to be the propeller shaft of the ship. It is encased in
						a metal grated cover with small metal labels placed every 20 feet or so. You
						see plaques for "Torque Release Valve 5", "Torque Release Valve 4".</p>
					<p>Then finally the metal plate for "Torque Release Valve 3" catches your
						attention. You place the plaque you have up against the new metal plate. The
						curved back of the plaque matches perfectly the form of the grated cover of
						the propeller shaft.</p>
					<p>"This is it" you motion to Farse and McCarthy. The heat is immense. Your
						forehead is dripping with sweat. Suddenly a blue flame runs down the length
						of the shaft.</p>
					<p>"Can you see that" you ask the others, but they don't seem to understand
						what your saying. "I see a line of blue flames running down the propeller
						shaft, can you see it as well?" Farse looks to McCarthy questioningly. Farse
						answers "No we can't Travis, do you think it wants us to follow it?"</p>
					<p>You nod you head and start moving down the shaft. The flame keeps ahead of
						you both for awhile then stops and takes a left turn into a small side
						hatch. You move into the hatch and the flames highlight an area of the the
						hatch completely darkened. You see a light of some sort, a small red light
						blinking. Moving your flashlight over the red blinking light you feel shock
						immediately start to grip you as you see a timer of some sort linked by
						wires to large wooden boxes. "This is a bomb!" you yell out to Farse and
						McCarthy, and come rushing out of the hatchway hysterically.</p>
					<p>Farse catches you and brings you back to your senses. "Calm down Travis."
						Farse says. "What did you see in there?" You point to the hatchway and
						mutter "bomb!" Farse moves into the hatchway and quickly comes out. McCarthy
						follows next.</p>
					<p>McCarthy moves out of the hatchway slowly, his skin is the whitish color of
						fear. "We need to get this news to the captain now!" All three of you start
						moving down the shaft corridor. "If that thing blows it will flood four or
						five water tight chambers. The ship will be doomed. Whomever put this here
						knew what they were doing." McCarthy says.</p>
					<p>"We need to move up the chain, even past the captain of the ship." Farse
						says "Ian is the man to see. He can sort this out faster than anyone. Ian's
						the acting CEO for Trans Atlantic Transports, the company that now owns this
						ship. He's on the top floor, follow me."</p>
					<p>You're exhausted at this point. The emotional roller coaster of the last 15
						minutes has been intense, but fortunately Farse thinks he can make a direct
						contact with the person who can matter the most in this moment. You all move
						up the ship, sometimes by ladder, sometimes by stairway, sometimes by
						elevator. Making your way to the top of this beast like climbing a mountain.
						Detective Farse knows the way like the back of his hand.</p>
					<p>Finally you stop and look up toward the now visible bridge area. "Ian's
						suite is right past the bridge and a bit farther back." He points with his
						finger. Making your way up there you're stopped by a set of glass doors.
						Farse moves over to the card panel to the side and swipes his card. The
						doors fly open and you move through into an amazing detailed area of the
						ship with the finest tapestries and antiques.</p>
					<p>Every thirty feet you see large images of the ship in various stages of
						construction. People shaking hands at the launching. Welders welding the
						hull together in dry dock. Images of groups of people standing for a
						portrait with blueprints hanging in the background. Images of royalty from
						around the world.</p>
					<p>Making your way to the elevator in the back you're stopped by a glass door.
						Farse takes his ID card out and swipes it at the card reader. This time it
						doesn't seem to work and an LCD screen lights up.</p>
					<p>"Hello there, may I help you?" the voice says questioningly. Farse speaks
						into the camera. "There is a very urgent matter on this ship and we need to
						talk with you right now. This can not wait. This ship is in danger!" Only a
						couple of seconds later the glass door to the elevator moves to the side and
						the voice says "Come in then." Ironically the voice seems somewhat casual.
						All three of you move into the elevator and take it to the next floor.</p>

					<p>Although it weighs heavy in your heart, you decide to take Madeline's advice
						as she seems to have a plan to get you off this infernal ship.</p>
					<p>She moves faster than you thought through the bowels of the ship, and you
						follow. Finally you reach a junction point. Three corridors interconnecting
						and the path seems to be blocked.</p>
					<p>Madeline tells you to "Wait here." and casually floats through the barrier
						of metal beams and miscellaneous pieces of rubbish. She soon returns back
						with a frowning look upon her face. "This is intentional. Someone knows that
						we are here." Turning around, as if on cue, you witness three apparitions
						approaching.</p>
					<p>The leader of this posse steps forward bearing a crude ghostly weapon
						consisting of a board with nails protruding from it. "We knew you would
						attempt to save the aggressor." he says.</p>
					<p>You realize that there is little you can do in this confrontation. Madeline
						is your chaperon now, and the burden lay squarely on her shoulders to get
						you off this ship.</p>
					<p>Madeline replies "This matter does not concern you. Step to the side and let
						us travel on." The ringleader seems to have different ideas though, "I don't
						think that you understand the matter Madeline. This aggressor has defiled my
						peoples leader. This can not go unpunished, we will no longer be bound by
						dimensional restrictions."</p>
					<p>Sensing that the confrontation has come to an impasse you prepare yourself
						whatever awaits. Madeline moves closer toward the leader and with the motion
						of her hands seems to create a barrier between you and the ghosts.</p>
					<p>"This will not be forgotten." the leader says, and vows vengeance hammering
						his club against the barrier. Madeline then turns and with another movement
						of her arms the metal debris and beams slowly give way. In an orderly
						fashion the debris moves down the hall to the sides so that you may pass by.</p>
					<p>Once again Madeline takes you forward. The screams behind you echo down the
						corridor. Finally after several flights of stairs and several more corners
						you get to a hatchway. You open it and find that you're in a hallway in
						front of a cafe. Madeline seems to be unnoticed by the passengers and moves
						freely through walls and people straight toward the table where Bernard is
						sitting. You follower and take a seat next to Bernard. He's shaken and
						surprised when he sees you especially considering you seemed to come out of
						nowhere.</p>
					<p>Bernard says "They are telling us that we must leave the ship, in a couple
						of minutes we will be asked to board the lifeboats. I fear that we will
						never see Sarah again." The same thought, of course, had crossed your mind
						but it seems now that there is no time left. The situation has come to a
						climax and there are no options on the table.</p>
					<p>Madeline speaks to you "Do not board the life vessels with the others. You
						must find your own way or else they will find you. There are those among the
						crew that are vessels for the dead and they will notify Jonas's clan of your
						whereabouts."</p>
					<p>Bernard can tell that you are listening to someone, and is smart enough to
						guess that it is a ghost. You turn to Bernard and tell him "we must leave
						now Bernard, this is our only option. Otherwise, the ghosts will find us and
						try to bring us to their world" You then motioned to leave the cafe.</p>
					<p>Following Madeline's lead you start to leave the cafe. Bernard seems a
						little hesitant but follows and all three of you move towards the bow of the
						ship.</p>
					<p>Madeline seems to know exactly where to go and, almost with a six sense,
						takes you to what appears to be a private lifeboat. She motions for you to
						enter and quickly shows you how to operate the mechanism to lower the boat.
						You follow her directions and the boat lowers far to the water. Unhooking
						the lines and starting the vessel, the motors seem to be working correctly.
						As you take the boat towards the land on the horizon you look back at the
						ship for the last time.</p>
					<p>Madeline directs you to a small harbor on the island of Crete, then
						disappears never to be seen again.</p>
					<p>Though tired you make the journey to the airport on the island, and purchase
						tickets on the soonest flight out of there. Arriving back in America you
						hear that the great RMS Queen Elizabeth II has sunk. This weighs heavy on
						your heart. Sarah may be gone forever, only time will tell.</p>

					<p>Looking back around you notice a glowing green item around the corner. The
						green lights up the surroundings brilliantly. Finally coming into view, you
						see the apparition. A woman you can tell. A woman that you know.</p>
					<p>Madeline moves toward you and whispers in in your ear. "You are in grave
						danger. Jonas will be looking for you and his father will be here as well.
						They are well-connected in the afterlife. There are armies of ghosts that
						will turn you in for the bounty that will be placed on you."</p>
					<p>Madeline motions for you to follow her. You move in her direction keeping
						your flashlight off. The glowing from her silhouette is enough for you to
						find your way through the metal and mechanical corridors. She takes you to a
						dark room. You follow closely behind.</p>
					<p>Moving her arms through the air she waved her hands towards a dark spot in
						the room. A shape starts to take form, a portal of some sorts. Through the
						portal you see several shapes start to materialize. You see a room with
						exquisite pillars and a human sized form laying down and symmetrically
						placed between those pillars.</p>
					<p>The mirage seems to move closer, Madeline zooms in on the form in the middle
						of the room. You see thousands if not tens of thousands of small insect-like
						creatures crawling over what seems like an object that vaguely has the shape
						of the human form. It reminds you of a bee colony engulfing a bee keeper.</p>
					<p>You look over Madeline questioningly. She pauses from her conjuring and
						starts to talk. "Look in the middle. That was once a human being. The
						greeters are taking form. They will be done before the end of the hour, and
						Jonas will live again. This time in my world not yours of course".</p>
					<p>Thoroughly confused you ask Madeline "What is going on here? Those insects
						they're somehow greeting Jonas?".</p>
					<p>"They are called the greeters. They shuttle the newly dead between the realm
						of limbo into a concrete form in the afterlife. Right now Jonah is no longer
						anything. He has been broken down into his individual elements. The greeters
						create form from this chaos and move him into the afterlife." You look at
						the mirage in front of you noticing the furious movement of the greeters as
						they build this form of a ghost.</p>
					<p>Finally looking over to Madeline, "What is to be done now?" you ask her. She
						motions to the object in front of you both the image, the apparition, the
						mirage. "Jonas will be back and it will be before the end of the hour. You
						need to stop your search for Sarah right now. Your time in this place will
						come to an end one way or another. Follow me and I will show you the way. I
						will take you to Bernard so you both can leave the ship."</p>
					<p>"Otherwise both of you will surely fall to Jonas, and having done so you
						will in turn be subject to his will in the afterlife for eternity."</p>
					<p>The thought of abandoning your search, the thought of giving up looking for
						Sarah weighs heavy on your heart.</p>
					<p>What do you do?</p>
				</content>
			</page>
			<page id="pg_jonas_kills_you">
				<content>
					<p>The thought of abandoning your quest to find Sarah seems too much for your
						heart to bear. Madeline can sense this by your posturing." I must find her
						otherwise I fear that I will never see her again. Will you help me find her
						Madeline?"</p>
					<p>Madeline takes a moment to reflect on your question, but soon she turns
						away. "I do not see a path down this train of thought. It is a dark road
						that you travel and all I can do is wish you the best on your search."</p>
					<p>Sensing that the conversation is coming to an end you respectfully bow your
						head in Madeline's direction and watch as she fades into the darkness.</p>
					<p>You feel completely isolated, alone in this dark place with nothing but the
						metal walls and creaking noises to disrupt you. Sarah must be found you
						realize this now. She is the light that you need in your life and nothing is
						going to divert your efforts away from finding her.</p>
					<p>Realizing that Jonas will be coming for you, you grab a sharp metal object
						laying in the corner. Of course you know that this will more than likely not
						have an effect on him but you're stumped for a better alternative. You
						really that you have no plans to deal with Jonas and the person who could
						possibly help didn't have any solutions either.</p>
					<p>Faith in the universe has been a core principle of your life and you realize
						that you are leaning heavily on that principle right now.</p>
					<p>A couple of hours have passed since you've heard the rustling of passengers.
						They all gathered their belongings and boarded into the lifeboats. The
						explosion of the helicopter has made the ship unstable and forced passengers
						and the crew into emergency evacuation. Since then the boat has been quiet.</p>
					<p>You venture onto some of the crew decks and see no one. Taking this as a
						sign that your suspicions are correct, and that the ship is now completely
						empty, you move up to the passenger decks looking through the areas hoping
						to find any clue that can lead you to finding Sarah.</p>
					<p>A creepy feeling comes over you as you move down the hallways in and out of
						the passenger areas and see not a single soul. The lights in the Casino are
						still blinking. The music is still playing in the cafes.</p>
					<p>You retreat back down to the crew areas feeling more comfortable hiding in
						the dark corners. Taking with yourself a day's supply of food you start to
						plan out your systematic search of the vessel.</p>
					<p>While you're planning this out a thunderous eruption of electricity creates
						a burst of light so intense that shadows create razor-sharp lines along the
						pipes and wires of the crew area. A thick cloud of green smoke creates a
						dust devil effect rattling the corridor and sending small pieces of debris
						into the air. Instantly you recognize this as your time of reckoning.</p>
					<p>The cloud slowly dissipates leaving a mangled ghostly figure standing.
						Unlike the other ghosts this figure has an orange aura. The deep gashes down
						his side look very new and glisten by the light of the corridor. Jonas turns
						around.</p>
					<p>Jonas speaks to you "It seems that fate has arranged us another meeting",
						Jonas says. "I no longer need your services as you have sent me here!" His
						eyes turn red. "Oh but don't worry you will be joining me shortly." He limps
						toward you moving slowly in a fashion that looks painful. The pipes and
						wires rattle as he approaches contrasting the frail figure in front of you.</p>
					<p>The struggle between the two is quick. Your last memory is Jonas looking
						down on you. "This is the end for you. I will see you soon." A half smile
						crosses is disfigured face.</p>
					<p>You find yourself lying on a platform surrounded by a semi circle of
						pillars. Small insects seem to be flying all around.</p>
					<p>You rise and find that you are now a ghost. Moving out of the semi circle
						the world seems to distort. The lines of the pillars seem to wobble. And
						then the scene vanishes and you find yourself on the ship, in the very spot
						which you had ceased to live at.</p>
					<p>Ghostly metal bars break through the ceiling crashing to the floor
						entrapping you in your current spot. Hours pass but you do not feel hungry.
						Then you see Jonas slowly limping around the corner ahead of you. He makes
						his way toward you.</p>
					<p>When he reaches the bars he stops and looks up to you. "You know Travis I'm
						coming to find that this past life actually has its advantages." Whimsically
						he looks at the bars a bit proud of his work. "Think of this as a start of a
						new life. A life where you will have time, a lot of time in fact, possibly
						an eternity to think about yourself and what exactly brought you to this
						point in your life."</p>
					<p>Looking at the gashes in Jonas's ghostly figure you have moral trouble
						judging his actions, even with all the horrendous thing he managed to
						achieve in his life. Jonas turns and leaves.</p>
					<p>Shortly thereafter you hear several giant explosions that rip the ship apart
						sinking it to the bottom of the ocean miles down. Your cage floods, but the
						water does not affect you. The ship descends into the depths until finally,
						after rolling down a cliff, the ship comes to a rest. The bars that entrap
						you are now the floor, but you are still trapped.</p>
					<p>The years pass by as if seconds on a clock. You feel neither hungry or
						tired, nor warm or cold. Life becomes something else, a figment of your
						imagination. Boredom and despair consume you until your consciousness takes
						on a new form.</p>
					<p>You witness in time-lapse as the ship dissolve in front of your eyes. Rust
						consumes all parts of the ship and barnacles find home in the pipes speeding
						up the deterioration. Sporadically pieces of the ship seem to fall and crash
						down, decks seem to crumble.</p>
					<p>Over what must be a thousand years your cell slowly disintegrates until
						finally you can see a space open to the sky, which you can move through to
						get out of your prison. But, seeing this, you decide to stay. It has been so
						long, and you are now comfortable in this home.</p>
					<p>One day you see a glowing figure moved by the opening leading out of your
						cell. For this instance time slows down to a crawl and briefly reminds you
						of your all to short moment of life.</p>
					<p>The figure looks through the opening into your cell investigating the scene.
						It is a woman who must've died at roughly 40 years of age. She moves through
						the opening closer and sees you. Her features look oddly familiar, as if
						something from a dream. She stops and slowly opens her mouth.</p>
					<p>"Travis is that you?"</p>
					<p>In the deep recesses of your mind you recall that name. You're time living
						is nothing in comparison to the mass of time passed the end of your life,
						but that name seems to be familiar so you keep on searching your memories
						for an answer. A name pops into your mind, the name that has forever been a
						part of who you now are.</p>
					<p>"Sarah?", you say instinctively.</p>
					<p>The woman seems pleased and replies, "It is I Sarah." You both move toward
						each other and embrace, a feeling that you have not felt for a thousand
						years takes hold. She says "I have been searching for so long I cannot
						remember when I started. When the ship sank that is when I entered this
						world, and since then I have been looking."</p>
					<p>Over the next thousands of years you and Sarah become one person with one
						mind and you realize that you were right to risk it all to find her.</p>
					<p>The End.</p>

					<p>Gaging the stare in his eyes you realize that there is no choice to this
						question, and that you'll have to accept. Hesitantly you accept his offer.</p>
					<p>Jonas appears to recognize your answer for what it is and replies, "Good. Do
						not think that I can't see right through you. We have a deal, and together
						we can accomplish great things. Don't take my support of you lightly or you
						may find the extent of my personality."</p>
					<p>You nod appropriately trying to disguise your disgust for Jonas. Off in the
						distance you hear a sound. A steadily flapping nose approaches. Jonas heads
						for his private elevator. You follow him getting your first feel of life
						under his elderly leadership.</p>
					<p>The elevator takes you both down to an exterior level overlooking a large
						flat deck area. The noise get much louder and the wind whips up across your
						body. Looking to the sky you see a helicopter off to the left of the smoke
						stack, approaching the landing pad on the deck below you both.</p>
					<p>Jonas heads down quickly and motions to you to do the same. The winds are
						intense and you grab for your shirt to tuck it in tighter. The helicopter
						lands on the deck and Jonas is quick to move into the cabin area. You still
						stay behind hesitant to jump into the helicopter, knowing that it will put
						you right into Jonas's hands completely.</p>
					<p>He looks at you from the cabin, annoyment seems to mark his face. He motions
						to you again, this time more forcefully than the first. A voice in your mind
						takes form, Sarah's voice seems to whisper to you the truth of what will
						happen to her if you jump in that helicopter and leave this ship. "Goodbye
						my love" her voice echoes in your head sounding as real as anything.</p>
					<p>Looking around the upper deck area you search for something, anything that
						can help you. A metal pipe springs to your sight and you run to grab it.
						Without thinking you throw the pipe up over the solid metal exterior of the
						deck. Knowing full well the carnage that will ensue you take cover in the
						most fortified area you can find within diving distance of your position.</p>
					<p>The sound is deafening as you hear the blades of the helicopter come into
						contact with the metal pipe you thrust into them. The metal quickly rips a
						propeller blade off and debris goes flying everywhere. The craft now being
						unbalanced whips around into a tailspin crashing violently into the exterior
						of the ship. After another split second you feel a shockwave of fire and an
						explosion rips through the helicopter, almost knocking you unconscious.</p>
					<p>Unable to hear, barely able to see, singed and confused from the blast which
						could have easily ripped you apart, as it did the cockpit, you try to move
						slowly at first and then with more speed. The staircase is almost completely
						destroyed except for the landing which you're standing on which has an
						exterior form that juts out about two feet. Everything in your vicinity is
						destroyed except for your spot. More than coincidence you wonder and quickly
						ponder the extent of the powers beholden in the other dimensions. "More than
						coincidence obviously" you mutter to yourself, and save the thought for
						later.</p>
					<p>Pockets of fire are everywhere. You decide it best to leave the scene at
						once. Limping over to the staircase you climb down what remains and quickly
						look back to the wreckage. The helicopter crashed into the side of the ship,
						exposing large gashes through the exterior. What remains lays in a flaming
						stack of ruble that most obviously no one survived.</p>
					<p>The thought crosses your mind "Jonas is dead" but somehow that doesn't seem
						to mean much to you at the moment. Even with that, you find yourself no
						closer to finding Sarah. You hobble over around the corner and through a
						gash in the wall into a dining area that fortunately was vacant. Quickly
						hiding yourself behind some large tables strewn on the ground you hear a
						flurry of people coming through from all sides. They quickly break open the
						emergency hoses and start spraying down the wreckage.</p>
					<p>You quickly duck into a hatch leading down to a maintenance area of some
						sort. As you're making your way into the hatch you look back at the smoking
						wreck. Through the gashed walls you look back at the wreckage. To your
						horror you make out two small green clouds moving around the scene of the
						accident, almost appearing to be looking for something. Without hesitating
						any further you duck into the passageway and close the door.</p>
					<p>Entering the corridor it is very dark. Pipes line the walls strung with
						electrical wires. You pull out your sat phone recalling that it has a camera
						that can be used as a flashlight and shine it around to see glimmering metal
						objects, handrails, metal grated floor platings.</p>
					<p>Closing the door behind you all light is shut off. Moving down the metal
						grated floor plating, the noise from the clanging floor plates makes you a
						little nervous as it could be heard from a long distance away.</p>
					<p>You move forward to see more pipes. The corridor seems to be getting
						smaller. You hunch over moving farther into the darkness hoping to hide from
						the situation that you just encountered. The thought of the ghostly green
						clouds floating around the helicopter scared you practically to death.</p>
					<p>Now there are two clouds whereas before there was only one. You understand
						the meaning of this and know that in the standard world the situation
						would've been over. You would have never had to see Jonas again.</p>
					<p>But, on the ship, at this time, this is not the case.</p>
					<p>The worlds are converging, the world of the living and world of the dead.
						They are all coming here to this place at this time. Jonas will be looking
						for you so you move farther into the darkness.</p>
					<p>Suddenly you hear clanging from the metal grated floor plates far up ahead
						around the corner. It sounds like somebody is running but still out of view
						so you hide in the corner behind some large metal objects and pipes.</p>
					<p>You turn off your flashlight. The noise gets closer. "cling cling cling
						cling", you start to hear breathing.</p>
					<p>A lantern moves back and forth highlighting the shadows on the pipes, on the
						pillars, on the walls and ceiling.</p>
					<p>The person is moving quickly in this narrow small passage "cling cling cling
						cling", you can see a glimpse of the person in the passageway as he passed
						by you. He keeps on going until finally hear him opening the passageway door
						and closing it behind himself. It must've been a worker of some sort.</p>
					<p>Moving out from your hiding place you continue forward this time a little
						slower knowing now that this passageway seems to be in use. After a couple
						of minutes you move a staircase and a dark opening appears. You cannot see
						the side of the walls. The moisture in the air causes your breathing to form
						small clouds.</p>
					<p>You think to yourself, "How in the world could I have created a worse
						situation for myself? Your mind answers back rhetorically "that seems pretty
						impossible really".</p>

					<p>The thought of abandoning your quest to find Sarah seems too much for your
						heart to bear. Rudolphe can sense this by your posturing."I must find her
						otherwise I fear that I will never forgive myself."</p>
					<p>Rudolphe takes a moment to reflect, but soon he turns away. "I do not see a
						path down that way. It is a dark road that you travel and all I can do is
						wish you the best on your search."</p>
					<p>Sensing that the conversation is coming to an end you respectfully bow your
						head in Rudolphe's direction and watch as he walks away fading into the
						darkness. Soon after you feel completely isolated alone in this dark place
						with nothing but the metal walls and creaking noises to disrupt you. Sarah
						must be found you realize this now. She is the light that you need in your
						life and nothing is going to divert your efforts away from finding her.</p>
					<p>Realizing that Jonas will be coming soon you grab a sharp metal object
						laying in the corner. Of course you know that this will not have any effect
						on him but you're stumped for a better alternative. You really have no plans
						to deal with Jonas and the person who could possibly help didn't have any
						solution either. Faith in the universe has been a core principle of your
						life and you realize that you are leaning heavily on that principle right
						now.</p>
					<p>A couple of hours pass since you last heard the rustling of passengers as
						they all gathered their belongings and boarded into the lifeboats. The
						explosion of the helicopter has made the ship unstable and forced it into
						emergency evacuation. Since then the ship has been quiet.</p>
					<p>You ventured onto some of the crew decks and see no one. Taking this as a
						sign that your suspicions are correct, and that the ship is now completely
						empty, you move up to the passenger decks looking through the areas hoping
						to find any clue that can lead you to finding Sarah and leaving the ship.</p>
					<p>A creepy feeling comes over you as you move down the hallways in and out of
						the passenger areas and see not a single soul. The lights in the casino are
						still blinking. The music is still playing in the cafes.</p>
					<p>You retreat back down to the crew areas somehow feeling more comfortable
						hiding in the dark corners. Taking with yourself a day supply of food, you
						start to plan out your systematic search of the vessel.</p>
					<p>Suddenly A thunderous eruption of electricity creates a burst of light so
						intense that shadows create razor-sharp lines along the pipes and wires. A
						thick cloud of green smoke creates a dust devil effect rattling the corridor
						and sending small pieces of debris into the air. The cloud slowly dissipates
						leaving a mangled ghostly figure standing. Unlike the other ghosts this
						figure has an orange aura. The deep gashes down his side look very new and
						glisten by the light of the corridor. Jonas turns around.</p>
					<p>You knew this date would arrive and unfortunately the day of reckoning is
						here. Jonas speaks to you "It seems that fate has arranged us another
						meeting", Jonas says. "I no longer need your services as you have sent me
						here!" His eyes turn red. "Oh, but don't worry, you will be joining me
						shortly." He limps toward you moving slowly in a fashion that looks painful.
						The pipes and wires rattle as he approaches contrasting the frail figure in
						front of you.</p>
					<p>The struggle between the two is quick. Your last memory is Jonas looking
						down on you saying, "This is not over, I will see you soon."</p>
					<p>You find yourself lying on a platform surrounded by a semi circle of
						pillars. Small insects seem to be flying all around. You rise and find that
						you are now a ghost. Moving out of the semi circle the world seems to
						distort. The lines of the pillars seem to wobble. And then the scene
						vanishes and you find yourself on the ship, in the very spot which you had
						ceased to live at.</p>
					<p>Ghostly metal bars break through the ceiling, crashing to the floor.
						Entrapping you in your current spot. Hours pass but you do not feel hungry.
						Then you see a figure slowly limping around the corner ahead of you. It is
						Jonas, and he makes his way toward you.</p>
					<p>When he reaches the bars he stops and looks up to you. "You know Travis I'm
						coming to find that the afterlife has its advantages." Whimsically he looks
						at the bars a bit proud of his work. "Think of this as a start of a new
						life. A life where you will have time, a lot of time in fact, possibly an
						eternity to think about yourself and what exactly got you here." Looking
						down at the gashes in Jonas's ghostly figure there is little that you can
						judge about his actions. Those gashes look immensely painful even for the
						brief second before they led to his death. He turns and leaves.</p>
					<p>Shortly thereafter you hear several giant explosions that rip the ship apart
						sinking it to the bottom of the ocean miles down. The water of course does
						not affect you. Instead you watch as the scene gets darker, and darker until
						finally after rolling down a cliff the ship comes to a rest. The bars that
						entrap you are now the floor of your cell.</p>
					<p>The years pass by as if seconds on a clock. You feel neither hungry or
						tired, nor warm or cold. Life becomes something else, a figment of your
						imagination. You witness almost in time lapse the ship dissolve in front of

						slowly disintegrates until finally you can see a space open to the ocean

					<p>Rudolphe seems like he's on pins and needles. He looks around and you get
						the feeling that he's expecting anything. "Well are you coming with me or
						are going on your own? Time is running short. And this is not the place for
						that to happen."</p>
					<p>Knowing that you don't have many options you move closer and start
						following. He makes his way back to the vent and crawls in, you follow. The
						piping leads down at a gentle angle around several curves, turns and winds
						through creating a sort of catacomb.</p>
					<p>"I know what happened Travis. I know that Jonas is dead and he'll be looking
						for you." Rudolphe says.</p>
					<p>You wonder how knowing this Rudolphe would still help. If the shoes were
						switched you have no doubt that you'd treat Rudolphe like the plaque and run
						away from him as fast as you could.</p>
					<p>"I have a plan Travis, and I owe you big time. You saved my life, now I'll
						repay the favor."</p>
					<p>Finally you get to another air duct hatchway leading into a room of some
						sort. Rudolph pulls a small lever and the vent falls to the floor with a
						loud metal clang. You move out into the room which is a little tricky
						considering the vent shaft is three feet above floor. But, with Rudolph's
						help, you're able to get out and look around.</p>
					<p>The room is dark, the lights are dim. Even with the dim light you can see
						that the room is filled with odd looking items. This seems to be a warehouse
						of some sort. Metal tubular objects, rounded brushed aluminum housings,
						glass blown into odd shapes. Small screens lining what looks like a control
						panel on a sidewall. There's a desk, a standard looking desk with a couple
						of pieces of paper on it.</p>
					<p>You and Rudolphe move over to the desk, and you notice how thick the dust
						is.</p>
					<p>"This, this was my father's workshop. He was an inventor of sorts. He was,
						how should you say, interested in the supernatural. Working for the British
						government he searched the world for information about life after death.
						And, the story just begins there. If I wrote a book about my father it would
						be a very large book with hundreds of stories of a time when things were
						different, far different."</p>
					<p>Looking around you move to a large brushed metal enclosure. A cage of some
						sort resides right next to the assembly. Another tower of brushed metal
						resides just beyond the cage. You see large electrical wires running through
						the warehouse, plugging into giant circuit breakers that run along the back
						walls of the room.</p>
					<p>Rudolph moves toward you, "This was one of his greatest inventions and it
						may come in handy today. Like I said, I heard about Jonas and I know that he
						will be here for you very soon. I don't think we have enough time to make
						our way on a lifeboat off this infernal ship before Jonas arrives. So, we
						need to prepare for a stand. The greeters will be done soon and there is no
						time."</p>
					<p>"Greeters? What are they?" you ask.</p>
					<p>"They shuttle the newly dead between the realm of limbo into a concrete form
						in the afterlife. Right now Jonah is no longer anything. He has been broken
						down into his individual elements. The Greeters create form from this chaos
						and move him into the afterlife. They will be done soon and he will be born
						into the realm of the ghosts."</p>
					<p>Just then the dim lights in the room spike. "They are coming," Rudolph says.</p>
					<p>Rudolph scurries around the room grabbing items and stuffing them into a
						backpack. You know not what to do so you stand there waiting to see where he
						goes.</p>
					<p>The lights start blinking rapidly and violently brighter and brighter.
						Finally the bulbs start to blowout, but somehow the light in the room is
						brighter than ever. Clouds of ghostly green smoke start to make there way
						into the room from all sides, and circle around you and Rudolph flowing in a
						vigorous wave of current.</p>
					<p>Rudolph runs straight for the metal cage and inside. He grabs you in the
						process, pulling you into the cage and closing the door. He then pulls a
						giant lever which takes up about half of the cage. You you hear a whirling
						sound, and a burning smell. The noise starts to increase in a mechanical
						high-pitched squeal.</p>
					<p>Small lightning bolts start to streak across the cage between two towers
						from outside. Metal bars in a crisscross fashion create an amazing display
						of light. You find yourself engulfed in it and a mass of lightning bolts.
						Somehow you seem to be okay within this metal cage.</p>
					<p>You look to Rudolph for guidance but he seems to not be concerned with the
						lightning bolts as much as he is with the clouds that are forming into
						objects such as chairs and tables, luxurious couches filled with ghostly
						people.</p>
					<p>Finally a large cloud of green smoke tries to enter the cage. Arches of
						electricity connect with the ghostly cloud seeming to keep it away. Turning
						it different shades of green, finally the cloud seems to give up and touches
						down just out of the distance and the sparks.</p>
					<p>The shape forms into a ghostly resemblance of the person known as Jonas. As
						he forms he says "You know why I am here. Travis, I'm seeking what's mine
						and what was taken away from. I want retribution for your acts of a sinister
						nature." The ghost paces frantically from side to side in front of his
						audience of ghostly cohorts.</p>
					<p>"I invited you into my world and you deceived me. I will be avenged."</p>
					<p>You see another figure materialize, it is that of Jonas's father. You
						recognized him from earlier. Jonas seems to go over and talk with his father
						for a moment. You get the sense that his father is saying that there is
						nothing they can do while you and Rudolphe are protected in the cage.</p>
					<p>Suddenly the scene seems to change. The dark blue tones of the room seem to
						morph into a much more orange tone, and dark reds and yellows fill the sky.</p>
					<p>You find yourself looking out over a landscape of red clay high on a
						plateau. The sky is a beating red. The heat is immense but survivable.</p>
					<p>A cloaked figure slowly walks up from another direction and into the enclave
						of the ghostly spectators. Pulling his hood from his head the new arrival
						seems to stand in opposition to the other attendees and especially Jonas.
						"What is your purpose here?" the figure asks.</p>
					<p>"Myself and my friends are having a peaceful gathering." Jonas says.</p>
					<p>The once hooded figure moves closer to Jonas. As if giving a presentation he
						says to Jonas and the crowd. "This act of aggression will not be tolerated.
						The lives of the living and the dead should be separated. We should not
						meddle in the affairs of the living."</p>
					<p>Jonas confrontationally yells back "Am I supposed to do nothing? I was alive
						just this morning and because of him I am no longer."</p>
					<p>The once hooded figure says, "Yes but you were human this morning, and now
						you are a ghost and must follow the rules as such. We have no right to bring
						others here, no matter what the circumstances. The wheel moves outside of
						our understandings."</p>
					<p>The figure moves closer to the cage but seems unaffected by the sparks.
						Rudolph takes a good look as the character approaches and seems shocked.
						"That Travis is my father." The figure approaches the cage and looks inside
						zeroing in on you. He seems to be disappointed in you, and you sense that he
						is not at all happy with you dragging Rudolph into this mess. Making eye
						contact with Rudolph he says no words, but turns back around to look at
						Jonas showing him that his powers are mightier than either Jonas or his
						father.</p>
					<p>Jonas seeing this asks "How do you do that, let me know. I will give you the
						world for the answer to that question."</p>
					<p>The figure moves closer to Jonas and says, "That answer you will never
						know".</p>
					<p>Jonas sensing that he is outmatched for the moment seems to cower away
						moving towards the audience of ghostly participants. "I can see how this
						will play out and we are in your realm for the moment. I will grow stronger,
						and I will be back."</p>
					<p>And with that Jonas and the other participants seem to vaporize. The room
						slowly melts back into the warehouse that it once was. Rudolph's father is
						still there and moves toward the gate. "My powers here are spent. You need
						to find an escape, there's no other choice. You have no asylum here
						anymore."</p>
					<p>Rudolph turns off the machine and opens the gate. The ghost of Rudolph's
						father vaporizes as the other ghosts did. Rudolph rushes over to the
						bookcases and grabs a couple more items and motions for you to follow him.
						You make your way through the ship hastily looking for a life boat. There's
						chaos in the corridors, people are getting ready to evacuate.</p>
					<p>Rudolph seems to know where to go, he seems to have a plan. You follow
						through the corridors, through the passageways down several flights of
						stairs and finally through a door out to a small deck with a lifeboat. He
						motions for you to get in the lifeboat which you follow. After starting the
						mechanism to lower the boat to the water, Rudolphe then jumps in. The boat
						lowers to the water as expected. Unhooking the lines and starting the vessel
						the motors seem to be working correctly. As you take the boat towards the
						land on the horizon you look back at the ship for the last time.</p>
					<p>You find your way to a small harbor on the island of Crete. From there you
						both journey to the airport on the island and purchase tickets on the next
						flight out of their. Arriving back in America you witness first hand as the
						media builds up the sinking of the RMS Queen Elizabeth II into a frenzy of
						excitement. Knowing your role in the sinking weighs heavily on your heart,
						especially considering the stakes.</p>
					<p>Sarah is gone. She may be gone forever, only time will tell.</p>

					<p>Suddenly you see a grate covering a vent leap from the wall. A head pushes

					<p>"Travis, it's Rudolphe!" the voice says.</p>
					<p>Gingerly he moves out of the vent. Rises to his feet Rudolphe brushing off

					<p>The vision becomes too much for you to turn down, so you accept his offer
						with one condition. The condition you stipulate is that Jonas helps you find
						Sarah. He seems to think for a moment and agrees to your condition although
						a bit tentatively. You broker the deal with a shake of your hands.</p>
					<p>Off in the distance you hear a sound. A steadily flapping nose approaches
						the ship. Jonas heads for his private elevator. You follow him getting your
						first feel of life under Jonas's elderly leadership.</p>
					<p>The elevator takes you both down to an exterior level overlooking a large
						flat deck area. The nose get much louder and the wind whips up across your
						body. Looking to the sky you see a helicopter just off to the left of the
						smoke stack of the ship. It is coming toward the landing pad on the deck
						below you both.</p>
					<p>Jonas heads down quickly and motions for you to do the same. The winds are
						intense and you grab for your shirt to tuck it in tighter. The helicopter
						lands on the deck and Jonas is quick to move into the cabin area of the
						craft. You follow noticing a ghostly green haze close behind.</p>
					<p>You climb in and Jonas signals to the pilot. The chopper starts to move up
						into the sky. You finish closing the door as you rise above the ship and
						head into the open air. A couple hours pass in which you both stay quiet as
						the chopper is very loud inside. It eventually lands on the lush green grass
						of a large private estate on an island of some sort. You're not quite sure
						where you are.</p>
					<p>You follow Jonas from the craft into an underground tunnel with a tram that
						shuttles you deeper into the compound. Arriving at you destination you have
						a view looking out over the Mediterranean sea with a spectacular vista.
						Jonas motions to a servant who quickly approaches. "See to it that Mr. Neff
						here is taken care of".</p>
					<p>"Yes sir." you hear and the servant shows you to a room with all the
						accommodations that you might need. They ask for your measurements for
						clothing and any other necessary items that you might desire.</p>
					<p>You stay at the compound for a couple of weeks, and later hear that the QE2
						had a mysterious accident which lead to its sinking shortly after you
						departed. Upon hearing the news you think about Bernard and Sarah.
						Fortunately it sounded like all of the passengers made it off board.</p>
					<p>Your travels with Jonas take you around the world over the next couple of
						years. The ghostly revelations you uncover are immense and lead to an
						understanding of the world that you would have never dreamed of. Still Sarah
						remains illusive, even after several years. You fear that you may have
						missed your opportunity altogether.</p>
					<p>Bernard thought you had died on the ship and by the time you finally felt
						safe enough to connect with him again he was far out of the PI business. He
						seemed very eager to put the whole situation behind himself, and gave you a
						rather cold shoulder. You never spoke again.</p>
					<p>Over the course of time you and Jonas didn't become any closer as he is
						always quick to put people at a distance. He seems to have no close
						contacts. Nothing to get through the armor he has created for himself.
						Eventually you start to feel that he is monitoring you more and more,
						leading to suspicion and disturbance in your life.</p>
					<p>One day he sets a meeting in his office for the morning so you arrive there
						to see an envelop addressed to you on the desk. You open it and find a pay
						check. A quickly scratched note saying "Your services are no longer needed."
						and with that your employment with Jonas was terminated, never to see him
						again.</p>
					<p>You never did get rich as he had promised, and he never did help you find
						Sarah either, but the stories you acquired during your mutual adventures
						could fill the pages of several books. But, knowing Jonas, the eyes of the
						devil himself are looking down on you at every moment. The stories you
						acquire will not be told to anyone ever. You will be a ghost in time
						yourself and realize that all betrayals of confidence would be paid for in
						your afterlife.</p>
					<p>You think about Sarah often and really miss her even many years later. Her
						persistent image in your mind makes you wonder if you in fact choice the
						right path or not. Only in a conversation with a spirit did you hear of a
						woman who went down with the ship. Her soul, along with the all of the other
						souls on the ship can now be found at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
					<p>You'll have to wait until your life on this planet is at an end to journey
						back, but the thought gives you hope.</p>
					<p>The End</p>

					<p>The hallway is floored with dark woods with a sinuous patters weaving like
						dark tentacles down the small hallway. Dark wood paneling lines the hallway
						walls. Small candle shaped lights with a delicate flicker to them ever
						trying to look like a genuine flame. In reality they're only clever light
						bulbs though. Black pillars hold up the wooden archway across a large
						doorway.</p>
					<p>You both approach a set of doors. Large iron knockers in the shape of
						medieval maces hang from the doors. Ian uses one gingerly, and the door
						opens.</p>
					<p>"Ian, I thought you'd never come" you hear a voice from inside the room.
						Entering the room you feel like you've entered a doorway into the past with
						hundreds if not thousands of years of history enclosing these walls. Peeking
						behind the door you notice that a servant is holding it open for you. He
						closes it behind you, but makes no attempt to make eye contact with you of
						any sort. The voice you heard was not this servant though, it came from the
						center of the room.</p>
					<p>"So you've brought the hero of the hour. The man who overcame ALL odds to
						find out the secret plots of this ship." His voice dripping with a cross
						between sarcasm and hate. "I would say we owe him our gratitude then." The
						elderly man sitting at a long knobby table of obvious antiquity and quality.
						The chairs around the table could have been made for a king. You notice a
						light green cloud of smoke next to the man in the chair. The smoke seems to
						settle next to the man and takes the slightly recognizable form of a man, a
						man of roughly a slightly older age.</p>
					<p>"Ian, bring him closer please. I'd like to look him over." Ian does as he
						commands.</p>
					<p>"So you have a gift I hear. Now I wonder what that gift might be." the man
						looks over to Ian briefly in jest. "Or was it all a coincidence? It's
						possible I guess, but probable no! So Mr. Neff, how did you come across the
						bomb?"</p>
					<p>You almost start to rattle off the same speech you told Ian, but sensing the
						stair of his eyes boring a hole right through your life's meaning, you
						become a bit too disturbed to continue the lie and hold your mouth shut, and
						your head down.</p>
					<p>The energy flowing in the room causes a spiral of black haze flowing in a
						circle at the top of the room. The thought of Dante's inferno crosses your
						mind. A layer of hell possibly. You feel very sick, your stomach is in
						knots, and your head is feeling like it's going to spring into a headache
						very soon.</p>
					<p>"I don't believe that we've been introduced." He looks at Ian a little
						disgusted. Obviously Ian is a bit on edge as well you guess. "My name? My
						name is Jonas." the old man says. He makes no attempt to hold out a hand
						just sits there finishing off his meal. "And, you are Travis Nefff" the
						words trail out of his mouth. "It's funny, the name almost sounds like a
						movie star or something. A cunning disguise of sorts for someone who is
						waaaay over their head!"</p>
					<p>Jonas makes no attempt to hide his contempt for you. The vague smoking
						ghostly figure sitting to Jonas's side whispers something in his ear. Jonas
						seems to be inspired somehow, like a thought just crossed his mind. "Tell me
						Travis, how did you find the bomb? Someone tell you by chance?"</p>
					<p>You again hold your breath feeling like the right thing to do in the present
						situation. You venture to guess that you're the only one in the room who can
						see the specter. Ian seems completely oblivious to him, but Jonas seems to
						sense its presence.</p>
					<p>Ian finally chimes in and describes the story that you told him about
						finding the bomb.</p>
					<p>"So that's it then, just random chance I guess." Jonas rises from his seat
						and moves closer to you. "Save your fiction. I want the truth. Who have you
						been talking to? I care not whether they are dead or alive. There are those
						on this ship who are plotting a conspiracy against me, and many of them I
						fear are not of the living." He looks over to you. "Many people would not
						believe such rubbish, but I would. Oh yes, tell me about the apparition who
						pointed you in the direction of the bomb, I would like to know. I would like
						to hear it from your own mouth."</p>
					<p>The ghost in the chair floats over to speak into Jonas's ear again. Jonas
						then asks Ian to leave the room. Ian seems pleased with the request and
						makes his way to the doorway where the servant promptly opens the door for
						him. "You too Martel, I want to speak with Mr. Neff alone." Hearing that the
						door servant proceeds out of the door with Ian and gently closes it behind
						himself.</p>
					<p>"Now, where were we?" Jonas moves in very close to you.</p>
					<p>Jonas moves out toward the balcony. "Lets talk out here. The air is warm for
						this time of year".</p>
					<p>You follow him out through the French doors and onto a balcony overlooking
						much of the ship and a vast swath of ocean. Ghostly figures seem to be
						standing in place like statues, diligently holding up columns supporting the
						roof down this stretch of the balcony area. Looking like green smoky roman
						gods lining the exterior structure wall. You hear thunder off in the
						distance, and a flash of lightning off on the horizon. The air is moist like
						it is ripe for a large storm.</p>
					<p>"Let me tell you a secret Travis. This ship has reached it's end. I'd rather
						keep it of course, but the ship is starting to churn up to many things that
						need be forgotten. Old wounds have been coming back. It is a dangerous ship,
						it could harm me if it isn't disposed of, and promptly."</p>
					<p>You stand there quite, not daring to say a word.</p>
					<p>"I can use a man like you Travis. You have a gift that is very clear." he
						says. "Of course, a man like that doesn't go for a small fee, you will be
						WELL compensated for your services."</p>
					<p>You venture to speak. "What would you have me do considering the ship may be
						'disposed of'?"</p>
					<p>"A reasonable question, but lets just say that with the things that I've
						witnessed this is not a horribly isolated situation. In fact it seems to
						happen to me somewhat frequently. I need a man like you who can communicate
						with people..." he continues "especially with dead people."</p>
					<p>A churning starts to grip your insides again. This is not a good
						conversation, not here, not with this man, not with the things that you've
						seen.</p>
					<p>The clouds seem to be circling around a vortex over the waters not too far
						from where you're at. This is going to be a big storm, and it will start
						soon. You both reenter the room and Jonas closes the doors. You see the
						elderly ghost open up a metal container and take a small pinch, then sniff
						it up his nose such as you had seen people do in movies from almost a
						century ago. He seems to have a proper tone about his actions, he seems
						confident in his control of the situation.</p>
					<p>Jonas says, "Let me tell you about a feeling I have, I feel that my father
						is in this room. I can hear his words floating on the air sometimes. I can
						sense his judgments of me. Travis, do you think that I'm wrong in thinking
						this way?"</p>
					<p>You look over to his father sitting on the sofa almost completely
						unconcerned with the conversation. Jonas tracks your eyes and seems to
						follow them to the sofa. He moves over to it. The ghost whispers something
						to him and a smile crosses Jonas's face. Then the ghost disappears into a
						cloud of smoke.</p>
					<p>"My father, let me tell you about him Travis. He was an amazing man, brutal
						in his own right, but amazing nonetheless. He conquered the world with the
						help of his associates. A man who lived up to his every expectation
						completely." Jonas continues. "I need someone who can channel him to me
						directly. Somehow we can not communicate that way currently. I sense him,
						but only in small chunks. I need his help, his advice especially in these
						times."</p>
					<p>"Will you join me Travis? My need for your abilities is strong. I can make
						you a rich man... With the snap of my fingers if will be done."</p>
					<p>He looks at you as intensely as the sun in a heat wave. You instantly decide
						that it wouldn't be a good idea to tell him no.</p>

					<p>As the elevator moves to the next floor you see that you're in a large area
						with large picture windows overlooking the horizon in the distance. A man is
						seated at a desk in front of the window, but you can't make out any
						features. The elevator very slowly comes to a stop. The glass door slides
						open and all three of you exit the elevator.</p>
					<p>"Manny I presume." The seated man says "And who might your companions be,
						please introduce them." the voice says.</p>
					<p>Manny moves forward toward the shadowed figure. "These are passengers" he
						says ,"Travis Neff" pointing to you and "Bernard xxxx".</p>
					<p>"Ah, Mr. Neff. I've heard your name over the last couple of days. I'm very
						sorry about your wife. I'm sure we'll find her."</p>
					<p>You thank him for the gesture, but look to Manny to speed up this
						interaction a bit by skipping the formalities. Manny moves forward, and you
						both follow slowly behind. "Ian, sorry for rushing things. There is a bomb
						on this ship and it will surely sink the entire vessel if it explodes."
						Manny looks toward Bernard for a second opinion, and he nods affirmative to
						Ian.</p>
					<p>Ian picks up a drink of some sort from the desk, and turns his chair to look
						out over the horizon. "Manny thank you for bringing this to my attention.
						Are you absolutely sure that you saw a bomb, and not some sort of fancy
						equipment with blinking lights? You must be very sure of this because I will
						have to call an evacuation, and thousands of people will have to grab all of
						their belongings and rush toward the nearest life boat. Do you have any idea
						how much this will cost? I can tell you right now, it will cost millions,
						probably 5 or 6 million in fact after all is said and done. So once again
						are you absolutely sure of this?"</p>
					<p>Manny is on the spot and you can see his brow beading with sweat. His job is
						surely on the line at this point. If it isn't a bomb his career is over,
						just like that in a blink of an eye twenty years of superb service will be
						lost into a press headline of very bad publicity with his name all over it.
						Manny steps back and thinks a bit before answering. He knows that time is of
						the essence as the bomb could go off at any moment, but if he's wrong...</p>
					<p>"I... I think that I know what I saw, but I can not make the decision by
						myself. Please have someone else go down and take a look before we
						evacuate."</p>
					<p>Ian leans back, seeming to be a bit relieved . "Fine I will have someone do
						that, now where did you find the device again?" Manny proceeds to explain
						the exact location to Ian in depth. Ian takes down notes and asks to be
						excused for a moment. He goes into another room with his notepad.</p>
					<p>You ask Manny "Where is he going?" Manny replies "I'm guessing he's getting
						a second opinion right now." Looking around at the exquisite furnishing you
						start into a conversation about the company that owns the ship and how Ian
						is the Chief Executive Officer of this company. "It's very infrequently that
						Ian voyages with the QE2, the flagship of his fleet. Only a handful of time
						have I seen him hear in the several years that he has been with the company.
						Still they reserve this room for him on all journeys. A beautiful place at
						that, with its own private elevator. It would surely catch a pretty penny,
						yet they insist on leaving it vacant the vast majority of the time."</p>
					<p>Ian has been gone for awhile and you all start to get a bit tense. "So you
						feel comfortable with Ian?" Manny gives an expression neither yes or no.
						"Why did he leave to go into the other room? What doesn't he want us to
						hear?" you ask Manny.</p>
					<p>Manny moves with his hands for you to pipe down a bit and motions his head
						toward the corner of the room. A security camera is housed inside a dark
						black dome. You get the point and keep your mouth shut.</p>
					<p>Finally Ian comes back into the room. "I've contacted a second set of eyes
						to look at thais matter." Ian is moving very quickly now and speaking rather
						fast. "We'll find out the nature of the problem. Thank you Manny for
						bringing this to my attention. Thank you all for coming here. On behalf of
						the crew and the passengers I thank you immensity. Lets hope that what you
						saw was just some sort of fancy contraption used for monitoring or some
						such."</p>
					<p>Ian then moves over to the side of the table and shakes hands with you all.
						"Manny I'll notify you as soon as we have word on the situation. I expect it
						will take thirty minutes or so before we get an answer." With that he
						motions toward the elevator.</p>
					<p>Manny seems surprised even shocked that Ian seems to be saying that the
						issue is over and asking him to leave. "Ian you must understand, everyone on
						this ship may be in danger. This is not a time for use to split up and go
						our separate ways."</p>
					<p>Ian meets his eyes "Manny, we have someone looking into this issue right
						now. PLEASE return to your post and you will be notified as soon as we know
						more." forcefully he motions toward the elevator.</p>
					<p>Manny and Bernard seem upset but catch their emotions and Manny forces a
						salute and proceeds to the elevator. You start to follow them as well.</p>
					<p>"Mr. Neff, actually we'd like you to stay for a moment, if you have the time
						of course." Ian says. Manny hears this and turns around to see Ian move
						closer to you. "There is someone we'd like you to meet," he puts his arm
						around your shoulder moving you to the doorway. You catch a glimpse of
						Manny's eyes and a thoroughly mixed emotion on his face. "What is going on
						here?" he seems to be saying without saying a single word. Ian refocuses you
						on the doorway and Manny turns back to the elevator.</p>
					<p>The doorway opens as you approach. You move with Ian through it into a
						rather short hallway.</p>

					<p>"Detective Farse I presume." The seated man says "And who might your

					<p>Farse moves forward toward the shadowed figure. "This is Ensign McCarthy,
						and a passenger named Travis Neff."</p>

					<p>You walk down to the security room to talk with Detective Farse about the
						plaque that you retrieved from the ghost world. The door is closed, you
						knock.</p>
					<p>Shortly after Farse opens the door. Oh, hello Mr. Neff, and waives for you
						to enter the office. The room smells of cigarette smoke. You figure that
						somehow he's disabled the smoke detector in the office,</p>
					<p>"What brings you here Mr. Neff?" Farse asks.</p>
					<p>"I found an object that I'm hoping you can help me find out more about. It's
						a small plaque that says 'Torque Release Valve 3' on it. You have any idea
						where it might belong?"</p>
					<p>Farse scratches his head for a bit. "You know Mr. Neff, I don't have any
						idea where 'Torque Release Valve 3' belongs. Do you feel that it's important
						for some reason?"</p>
					<p>You get the feeling that this is going to be a tough sell. "Well yes, I
						think it might be important..." You try hard to think up a way to
						communicate to him why you think it's important, but catch your tongue for a
						second and remain speechless.</p>
					<p>Farse motions with his hands as if trying to help you get the sentence out
						"And why again do you feel strongly about this plaque?"</p>
					<p>You reply "Lets just say that I found it in a location where it seemed like
						it was intentionally placed there for me to find." Farse seems unsatisfied
						with the answer. "And where do you say you found it again?"</p>
					<p>You hold your tongue again not wanted to get caught telling a lie, but not
						wanting to tell the truth either. Finally you give in and try to float a
						fib, "I found it on the ground by my room."</p>
					<p>"By your room you say? Well maybe it's from the engine room. Engineers will
						often travel through the passenger areas now and then. I bet on of them they
						dropped it."</p>
					<p>You can tell that Farse is getting bored and wants to drop the conversation,
						but you force the issue. "The plaque looked extremely old, I don't think it
						was dropped there by accident."</p>
					<p>You can tell that Farse is getting agitated a bit. "Oh, ok. Can I see it?".</p>
					<p>A bit Embarrassed you reply "Well I don't really have it right now. I gave
						it to another passenger who is currently trying to find out more information
						on it."</p>
					<p>"Oh, so someone else is already looking into it. Great, it sounds like
						you're on top of this already." Farse says.</p>
					<p>You reply "Well I haven't heard back from him yet, but I was wondering if
						you could look into it as well." You reply.</p>
					<p>"Look Mr. Neff, I really don't have time for this. You said that someone
						else is already looking into the matter. Go track them down yourself and
						find out if they've found anything out will you?" Farse moves toward the
						doorway. "I'm very busy right now Mr. Neff" motioning for you to move out of
						the room.</p>
					<p>You follow his gesturing and both part ways. You decide to take a trip back
						up to Mark's room to see if he's found out anything, Knocking on his door
						you hear something move inside but no one comes to the door. You knock
						again. Still nothing.</p>
					<p>Thinking to yourself you wonder if you should break into the door, but it
						seems a bit much at this point, especially considering whomever is inside
						there already may not think kindly of it.</p>

						in order to communicate with the ghosts. Some sort of extra sense. "What is
						that specialness?" you wonder.</p>
					<p>Even as a child you always had a knack for seeing things differently than
						most people. You thought it was something that everyone went through, but as
						you got older you realized that it was in fact something unique. On several
						occasions growing up you thought that people were talking to you. Turning
						around you'd see nothing. As a child you thought it odd, confusing. As an
						adult you thought it some sort of psychological issue, until you discovered
						paranormal research. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; Following your interests into
						PI work you realized that it was more than a fluke, and eventually marketed
						yourself as having these unique abilities.</p>
					<p>Nothing could have prepared you for this ship though. The inter-dimensional
						forces here are on a whole different scale from what you've seen or heard of
						anywhere else.</p>
					<p>Arriving at Mark's door you knock and he slowly answers. "Hi Mark." You
						exchange introductions telling. Oddly he doesn't invite you into his room to
						chat. You decide to tell him about the plaque anyways.</p>
					<p>"I have something I'd like to show you". Pulling the plaque out of your
						pocket you hand it to him. He looks it over a bit.</p>
					<p>"Where did you get this?" he asks abruptly.</p>
					<p>Somewhat dodging the question you clumsily state "I found it." Then continue
						"You have any idea where it goes?"</p>
					<p>Mark begrudgingly seems to answer your question "I can't say for sure, it
						looks like a disregarded sign of some sort. Do you mind if I borrow it?"
						Mark asks looking at you rather forcefully.</p>
					<p>Hesitantly you let him take the plaque. Sarah is still missing and it seems
						like this item is somewhat important. Hopefully Mark can piece the clues
						together.</p>
					<p>He replies "I'll check this out and get back to you." He moves back into the
						room just enough to shut the door. While closing the door he says
						"Unfortunately I have to go for now. Urgent business to attend to. I'll
						notify you if I find something." Abruptly he shuts the door and you find
						yourself standing in front of a closed door that seemed to be shut in your
						face.</p>

					<p>Heading back to your cabin you wonder about the meaning of the plaque. Why
						would the dimensions of the after-life want you to have this? What could
						they possibly mean with a simple plaque obviously meant to be affixed to an
						object of some sort? The older you get the more you realize that you really
						have no clue about many things in life that you once thought you knew
						implicitly.</p>
					<p>Entering your cabin you hurriedly make your way through the door which
						closes behind you. Heading straight for the phone you pick it up and dial
						the operator. "I'd like to speak to Detective Farse". The operator patches
						you through. Thumbing the plaque in your hands you turn it over and over
						again hoping to find something, a mark maybe, something more than just what
						it appears to be.</p>
					<p>"Detective Farse here." he answers.</p>
					<p>"Hi detective this is Travis Neff, there's been an incident that I wish to
						tell you about. I'm hoping that you might shed a bit of light on it for me."</p>
					<p>"Oh" he replies "And what might that be?".</p>
					<p>"Well, something happened a bit ago and I'm now left holding a plaque of
						some sort. It looks like something you might find down in the engine room
						affixed to a piece of machinery. It says 'Torque Release Valve 3' on it. I'm
						hoping that might ring a bell of some sort."</p>
					<p>There's a long pause over the phone, he finally replies "No I can't say that
						it rings a bell of any sort. How again did you come by this plaque?"</p>
					<p>"It's a complicated story" you say quickly searching your brain for an
						answer that would sound a bit better than telling him that you've been
						teleported to a ghost world. It just doesn't roll off the tongue very well.
						You say "I found it will searching the through my luggage, but I don't
						recall ever putting it there."</p>
					<p>"OK, I'll check with the engine crew and try to find out if anyone knows
						about this sign. If you could stick around for a bit it would be helpful. It
						should only take a little while to get you an answer. I know that Anton (the
						ship's captain) is on duty right now and he knows every square inch of this
						ship." Farse says.</p>
					<p>"Great. Thanks detective." You say and hang up the phone. You grab yourself
						a glass of carrot juice from the fridge and wait for his call. He calls back
						soon after "Mr. Neff, Anton says he knows where the plaque goes. He wants to
						see it first though before he lets us down into the engine area."</p>
					<p>Farse says he'll drop by your room in 10 minutes so you clean the place up a
						bit before he arrives. It's been an exhausting couple of days and your room
						looks like a whirlwind swept through it.</p>
					<p>Farse arrives on schedule and you invite him in. Slowly making his way into
						the room he makes no attempt to hide the fact that he's scanning your room
						as he enters. Noticing a small metal box on the dresser he moves closer.
						"EMF detector hey? Guess your planning for the supernatural while aboard."</p>
					<p>An EMF detector is a gauge that measures the Electro Magnetic charge at any
						point. If the charge is high it often means that there is a poorly wired
						connection close by that is giving off a large EM charge. It is also a
						device often used to purportedly hunt for ghosts. You dodge the statement
						all together and show Farse the plaque. He takes out his glasses and looks
						over the artifact.</p>
					<p>"Seems to be rather old. This ship goes back pretty far and I wouldn't be
						surprise if thats an original artifact from it." He says. "And how did you
						run across it again?" Farse asks giving the object back and picking up the
						EMF detector to look it over closely as well.</p>
					<p>"I found it in my luggage." you stick with your story sounding a little
						insistent.</p>
					<p>"Found it in your luggage? Sounds good to me." he says putting down the EMF
						detector and giving you a look of disappointment over the rim of his
						glasses. "You know Travis, I've been here quite awhile and I'm familiar with
						the reports of strange things on this ship. I understand that
						psychologically being out at sea for long durations is a strain on the human
						psyche, and this causes strange things to happen to people in general. But,
						having been here long enough to hear the stories, and talk with the people
						involved in them, I must be honest, I would not deny you if you told me that
						something else existed. Something else outside of this world that somehow
						comes back every once in awhile. I would not deny it one bit."</p>
					<p>Taking this cue you open up a bit "Detective, I experienced something just a
						bit ago and this is what I was left with by the end of it. I don't know what
						to make of it, and I don't want to talk about how I got it for now. It seems
						important so I want to track this clue down. Sarah is still missing, and I
						can't help but think that there is a relationship with her and the strange
						occurrences on this ship."</p>
					<p>"The ships captain is waiting for us up on the bridge, and he is not a man
						to be kept waiting. You will understand when you meet him." And with that
						Farse and you move out of the cabin and travel up to the bridge to speak
						with Captain Anton.</p>

					<p>You decide not to pick the lock to the door and instead head back to your
						cabin for a refreshment. Drinking a glass of champagne you realize how the
						bubbles feel invigorating against your pallet.</p>
				</content>
			</page>
			<page id="pg_dont_go_through_portal" location="Hallway">
				<content>
					<p>Through the portal you see darkness and despair, a difficult combination to
						stomach while already at one of the darkest points of your life. You look
						over toward Max. "No, I'm not going". Max gives you a sidelong glance
						"Through the door lies answers to your questions. Can you afford to pass up
						this opportunity?"</p>
					<p>You get the feeling that Max is a little too wrapped up in judging your
						choice, you wonder if he has some alternate agenda here... or is it just
						curiosity? "No, that's final. This is too far out for me to even try at a
						time like this. Lets say I go through and the portal closes. Then I will for
						sure never be able to find Sarah. The risk is too great." With that you look
						at your watch noticing that a couple of hours have passed by.</p>
					<p>"I must be going now Max, I have several other directions to continue the
						search. Thank you for showing me this, and showing me what you know Max."</p>
					<p>Max says a bit begrudgingly "My pleasure Mr. Neff, and goodbye for the
						moment." With this you both part ways and exit through the door to his
						ghostly study.</p>
					<p>Hearing something you look back. The door seems to fade away and the wall
						takes its former place. "Till we meet again Max" you mutter to yourself. The
						ballroom is empty bearing no proof of any sort that a festival had been
						staged here mere hours ago. It's dark with only a couple of lights left on.
						Enough for you to make your way back to the elevator.</p>
					<p>You find it hard to believe that two hours just flew by. You wonder if maybe
						the dimensional portal had something to do with it.</p>
				</content>
			</page>
			<page id="pg_go_through_portal" location="Hallway">
				<decisionvar name="pg_go_through_portal" value="true"/>
				<content>
					<p>You opt to enter the door and pass into the world of the spirit, but before
						you step into the portal Max warns you "The chambers of the past are formed
						into tetrahedral zones that move back and forth between each other. In other
						words Mr. Neff, within the portal time will fluctuate. What seems like a
						minute can be a year, and what seems like an hour can be a split second. The
						intricacies the complexities of this equation are immense. Peril can befall
						any emotional weakness in the unending, and unrestricted existence you will
						enter. Prepare yourself for this, and with that you gather your nerve to
						cross the threshold. An imagined vision of Sarah being reunited steps into
						your mind somehow giving you the courage necessary to take the plunge.</p>
					<p>As your foot hits the other side it rests on a patch of moistened dirt. Your
						other foot follows and you are through the portal. The air is chilly like a
						spring night in the mountains. Moisture is floating on your breath. You take
						a second to look around and can see Max through the portal. "Good work
						fellow, now look around. Does anything strike your attention." You do as Max
						suggests and see a slight flickering of a fire off in the distance. Someone
						appears to be camping out here and you see the shadows dancing around the
						fire. You also notice the railroad tracks leading up past a dilapidated
						cabin with a sign saying "Supplies". You decide to concentrate on the fire
						for the moment.</p>
					<p>Someone is obviously down there and you move toward it. The patches of grass
						on the ground seem to be growing right in front of your eyes, yet the moon
						stays fixed in the sky not budging an inch. The grass quickly grows to full
						length and dies to be reborn again. This seems to be a recurring cycle here.
						The figure down by the fire has stopped moving, a gentle breeze blows
						against your face and you move closer.</p>
					<p>When you get to the fire you see a person dressed in a large cloak. He shows
						that he's aware of your arrival by gently patting his hand on the large
						fallen log he sits on. He seems to want you to join him there. You move
						closer noticing the strange shapes that are appearing in the fire. At one
						point you swear that you saw a Minotaurs head, and then it swiftly
						disappears. Once again the figure motions for you to take a seat next to
						him.</p>
					<p>You notice something, the hand he's motioning with is barely visible under
						the long garment, but still you notice. The hand is skeletal. This
						disturbing revelation pauses you in your tracks and you stop. Through the
						flickering of the fire you can see that the man's jaw is also bone. Without
						raising it's head any further it lifts a hand toward you holding it out face
						down as if it wants to give you something. You tentatively put your hand
						underneath and it drops an item into your it.</p>
					<p>As you hold the item up to the fire you realize that it is a metallic item
						of some sort. The fire lightens the front of the item and you can see a thin
						metal sheet with stenciled letters painted on "Torque Release Valve 3".
						Having no idea what this means you slip it in your pocket. The hooded figure
						then slowly gets up and grabs his walking stick. Slowly he moves off into
						the dark never looking back. His work is done you figure.</p>
					<p>Looking at the fire you can see shapes take form again. Shapes that look
						like a random assortment of arrows seem to be pointing back up the hill. The
						fire also seems to gently bend in that direction as well prompting you to
						you move back a bit. Looking over your shoulder you see the cabin up on top
						of the hill so you move in that direction. The branches of the trees are
						growing but loosing no leaves as you walk up to the cabin.</p>
					<p>Opening the door to the cabin the first thing you notice is an old creaking
						rocking chair seated facing the fireplace. A shadowed figure looks over to
						you. "God, is that Sarah" you mutter to yourself.</p>
					<p>Gathering your nerve you move forward into the cabin. The door gently closes
						behind you and you hear a "click" as it shuts. Gingerly shuffling closer you
						realize that the woman is bound to the chair. She remains quite as you move
						close. Then suddenly the figure in the chair vanishes. You look around
						wondering where she went and hear something drop to the floor.</p>
					<p>Bending over toward the item you can see that it's a ring and loops in
						circles for a couple of seconds before coming to rest. Picking it up you
						realize that it is the fake wedding ring you and Sarah bought for the trip.
						Then you hear her voice coming through the walls "I'm waiting for you. I'm
						still waiting for you..." and it trails off. This startles you and you
						immediately drop the ring.</p>
					<p>Looking back around you notice that the door you entered through seems to
						now look like a cabin door in the ship. You move closer but can not make out
						the numbers marked on the door, it is fuzzy for some reason. You then see a
						red light beating like a heart through the door, you get the feeling that
						this is a symbol for Sarah's heart and that her heart is still beating. Then
						the vision of the door fades back into the bare wood door that you recall
						entering through.</p>
					<p>The visions are taking their toll on your sanity and you realize that you're
						starting to loose your balance a bit. A vertigo of sorts you speculate. You
						leave the cabin. Walking back through the night you approach the portal. The
						edges of the portal have a sharp jagged look like a split crystal. You move
						through the portal back to Max's study. He's sitting in his chair smoking a
						pipe. Smoke billows through the air.</p>
					<p>"Oh there you are chap, I've been waiting for you for hours. Find anything?"
						You feel around in your pocket touching the metal piece that was given to
						you by the creature by the fire. Pulling it out you take another look at it
						then hand it to Max who seems to make no sense of it either.</p>
					<p>You can sense that the hours have passed by in this world although it only
						seemed like twenty minutes or so in the ghostly world. You feel eager to get
						back to your cabin as not to waste more time and tell Max "I need to go,
						time is running short for me and this trip will wrap up shortly. If that
						happens I fear I will never see Sarah again."</p>
					<p>Max nods in agreement and follows your statement with "Then you must go good
						fellow. Find your love and set things right. Good luck on your adventures."
						You exit through the door to his ghostly study and you hear something.
						Looking back the door seems to fade away and the wall takes its place. "Till
						we meet again Max" you mutter to yourself. The ballroom is empty bearing no
						proof of any sort that a festival had been staged here mere hours ago. It's
						dark with only a couple of lights left on. Enough for you to make your way
						back to the staircase.</p>

					<p>Madeline then starts to move slowly toward the magician entertaining the
						crowd at the table. His long thin mustache wraps itself into circles at
						either side of his mouth. "Maxwell Borga is as unique an individual in death
						as he was in life. He is the one who arranged this event, and he is the only
						one who knows how to go about doing something like this."</p>
					<p>"In his life he was a scientist working for the Edison company. Of course
						Mr. Edison got all of the credit for his work, but Maxwell assures us that
						he had a big part in the 'perspiration' that ended up with the first light
						bulb, and the first phonograph. He is truly an exceptional individual and
						would be the first one to tell you so." she chuckles lightly.</p>
					<p>"He is not plagued with shyness or undue modesty, but you will find this for
						yourself."</p>
					<p>Madeline then strolls over to the the side of the table, past the large
						crowd that has formed, and straight to Max. She does not seem to be
						concerned that he is in the middle of a trick involving large linked rings
						at the moment. Whispering in his ear his eyes open widely as if expecting
						the message. Max then returns to the trick at hand.</p>
					<p>The goal of the trick appears to be to unconnect the rings, which seems
						pretty obvious considering they look ghostly transparent to you in the first
						place, but the crowd seems impressed and claps admirably for the
						performance.</p>
					<p>He then motions to the ghosts in appreciation "Thank you ladies and
						gentlemen, this has been a great crowd. Please don't let the evening pass by
						without trying some of the refreshments we've put together over at the
						buffet table. Thank you all for coming." The crowd slowly dissipates and
						Madeline takes the opportunity to bring Max over to talk with you.</p>
					<p>"Hello good fellow" Max says introducing himself. He takes his top hat from
						his head and slightly bows with the hat over his heart. You return the
						greeting with a slight bow and a smile. Madeline then says to Max "Mr. Neff
						has decided to grace us with his presence at this gala." Max looks over
						"Well thank you for that Mr. Neff." Madeline slowly moves from the scene.</p>
					<p>Max has obviously been waiting for you and says "Things are moving fast in
						this day and age, we have several things to talk about. Having a connection
						to the world of the living is a great asset to us."</p>
					<p>"You are unique Mr. Neff," he says, "It is extremely difficult to find
						someone with the exact combination of qualities that allows us to
						communicate with them. Not only does the individual have to be perceptive,
						but they also have to have an open mind. This combination in most people
						leads to emotional havoc."</p>
					<p>Max moves toward a doorway at the edge of the room. "Let me pose a question
						to you Mr. Neff. If you had the opportunity to come over to our world would
						you take it?" It seems like a rather loaded question so you just shrug your
						shoulders in uncertainty and let Max pan out the response a bit more. "More
						exactly if you had the ability to transport yourself to another dimension
						would would your mind be able to handle it?"</p>
					<p>You roll the question around in your head and answer back "Well, what would
						I gain by doing it in the first place?" Max then returns the shrug of the
						shoulders you gave him and answers "I'm not sure, we've actually never had
						someone of the living to test the question on so I'd have to answer as
						truthfully as possible... I don't know. What I do know is that you may find
						the answers you are searching for. Of course we all have several answers
						we're searching for, but in particular you might find a clue of sorts. This
						is all that I know as the world of the spirits is driven by the unique
						dreams of the individuals that inhabit it.".</p>
					<p>Max makes his way for a door and you realize that it has a ghostly aura
						around it which makes you think that this door isn't really hear, but a
						splicing of two dimensions. The dimension of the real, and the dimension of
						the spirit is how your mind simplifies it. It's sounding more and more like
						the answer is much more complicated than this though. Max talked about
						dimensions moving in and out of a focus of sorts. Complexity...</p>
					<p>He opens the door and you see a small cozy study lined with book cases with
						two chairs and a desk all having a ghostly aura. The desk has several
						different mechanical contraptions on it one of which being a small device
						which makes a small sound every second (like a metronome). You follow Max
						into the room.</p>
					<p>"So Madeline says that you were quite an inventor in your lifetime." You say
						making small talk. The gentle consistent tick-tick-tick of the device making
						you infinitely away of the passing time. Max nods back with a bit of pride
						"Yes I worked for Thomas Edison, he was a great man indeed, and driven such
						as I have never seen before. But, that was a long while ago, and I have
						moved on to greater endeavors..." Max says with a silent pause following.
						Leaning forward he slowly enunciates tel-e-port-ation."</p>
					<p>You see Mr. Neff the world of the living isn't much different than the world
						of the dead in terms of dimensional connectivity. But, the variability is
						very different when measured in terms of dimension of spirit. For example,
						you never quite know what you're going to get when you connect to another
						parallel dimension, but in the world of the living it is fairly obvious what
						you will get. The trick in creating the portal involves cunning
						cross-dimensional interconnections. The results are uncertain to say the
						least, but can be somewhat statistically compensated for." he says as he
						pulls a book from the library bookcases.</p>
					<p>You both sit and chat for several minutes, he asks you several questions
						about the state of the world from your perspective, all the time seeming to
						peel the meaning from your answers like an onion. He seems to derive many
						things about you from your answers, but seems hesitant to speak his mind.
						You wonder if somehow this makes a difference in his calculations.</p>
					<p>Max then walks over to the mechanical device on the table. It has a couple
						of orange lights that seem to be blinking to a steady rhythm. He moves the
						handle of the device and the rhythm of the flashing lights comes closer and
						closer until finally you only see a solid orange light that seems to project
						against the wall. The wall seems to swirls and opens up into a vista
						overlooking another view.</p>
					<p>Inside the other view it looks dark, very dark. You can see the stars in the
						sky and even hear a toot from an owl. The stars light up the ground enough
						for you to make out railroad tracks, and a small shack down the line with a
						single lantern fixed to it's side. Underneath the lantern is a sign saying
						"Supplies". Max looks over to you "This is your vision Mr. Neff. I like you
						only see darkness ahead, but maybe there is something to be gained from the
						experience. Will you follow into the illusion that has been cast for your
						eyes?"</p>
					<p>Getting closer to the projection on the wall you put your hand through it.
						The air on the other side is cold and damp as you might expect from the
						scene. You look over to Max and tell him "The answer that I care about more
						than anything right now is finding Sarah. If I pass through there will I
						find what I'm looking for?" Max grins back to you in response. Extraneous
						light from the projector shines on his cheeks highlights his round teeth and
						sharp angles. "We can only hope Mr. Neff."</p>
					<p>You reply "One final question, if I go through will you be coming with me? I
						fear this world you have shown me, and I need a guide." Max seems to take a
						second to respond. "I can not enter your world Mr. Neff" He presses his hand
						into the projection and it stops at the wall to show you the situation. "I
						will be hear though, and you will be able to see and hear me through this
						portal. That is as much as I am currently able to do."</p>
					<p>Do you pass into the portal?</p>

					<p>"I'll introduce you to Max here in a moment, but first let me take this
						opportunity to show our sincere appreciation for all that you've done for
						us. The documents that you handed off to David have been what you call
						'faxed' to several news agencies around the world. As the investigations
						deepen we feel that the truth will be revealed and the curse that has
						imprisoned us all will finally be lifted so that we can continue are
						journeys in the afterlife (wherever they may lead us)."</p>
					<p>Madeline raises her glass high and makes an announcement to this ghostly
						audience. "My fellow other-dimensional inhabitants, raise a glass to the air
						in dedication to the man who has brought us our freedom once again!".</p>
					<p>Slowly the tone in the ballroom comes to a silence and one by one glasses
						start to reach to the air. You can see the hollow eyes of many of the
						partiers as they channel the emotion and exhibit the pain of the time spent
						here reliving prior memories over and over again. You get the feeling that
						some of the younger members of this costume ball have been here for a very
						very long time. A timespan that essentially dwarfs the time that was spent
						here in the world of the living. A sad reality indeed.</p>
					<p>She continues, "We will move on our separate ways into the unknown as we
						were intended to do, as is the natural course". She pauses and says,
						"Cheers". The motion is seconded, thirded, and agreed upon by every member
						of the room which looks rather odd considering the varying costumes of the
						event.</p>
					<p>Then the specters slowly start back into their individual conversations. The
						band starts back into their music, the exhibitors start back into their
						acts, and things return to where they once were. Oddly enough you get the
						sense that you will meet many of these apparitions again. There is no doubt
						in your mind at all.</p>

					<p>"Those documents... they are very dangerous for you to be holding onto. In
						many ways the ghostly world isn't that different than the world of the

					<p>Madeline moves closer to you "If you do not hand them off, I will take no

						for yourself, the afterlife can have strong connections back into the world

					<p>"The word is spreading, I can feel it move from soul to soul unconsciously.
						Many of these wretched souls have been here for quite awhile and know how to
						pull information from the air. Our secret will last only for a short time."</p>
					<p>Madeline motions with her eyes over to an elderly ghost sitting in a chair
						minding his own business. The air around him seems to gel into a
						semitransparent smoke that hovers around him. He takes no notice as the
						smoke passes through his ears, in one side and out the other but somehow the
						expression on his face tells you that he learned something from that
						interaction although he seems to not be aware that it happened at all. He
						shows a grimace as if he just had a grand insight.</p>
					<p>"Give David the documents as soon as you can." Madeline whispers to you

					<p>A face in the crowd catches your attention. A figure dressed up like a
						queen. The style of garment looks like Queen Victoria. You realize that
						timing-wise that would make sense as when these specters roamed the earth
						Queen Victoria ruled a significant percentage of the planet.</p>
					<p>She sees you and motions for you to move toward her into the crowd of
						people. Hesitantly you move her way. The specters seem to make little
						acknowledgment of your presence, quite odd really. You wonder if most of
						them can not see you, and just sense your presence moving out of your way.</p>
					<p>"Hello Mr. Neff, so glad you could join us on this festive occasion," the
						woman says shocking you a bit by her directness and of course by the fact
						that she seems to know who you are although you can't say the same for her.
						"My name is Madeline, I am a spirit that has returned to this ship." she
						says pausing for a moment. "We put on this event roughly four times a year.
						It's a chance for our constitutes to mingle with one another. Usually us
						ghosts are secluded from each other by the various dimensional disparities
						between us. The average ghost can only communicate with a handful of others,
						and this becomes quite boring for many of them."</p>
					<p>Pondering her statement you ask "So then how are you able to get everyone
						into the same room together on these special occasions?"</p>
					<p>"Good question Mr. Neff. I am not familiar with the exact details of the
						process but that man over there can give you some answers." She points to a
						man in a top hat and a formal tuxedo sitting at a very crowded table doing
						what appears to be magic tricks. The audience claps and several people
						chuckle in response to his show.</p>

					<p>You can tell by the card reader on the door that picking this lock is going
						to be rather complicated. You pull out your wallet. Opening it up you slide
						a card out of it's protective sleeve. This card is unlike other cards in
						that it is only about half the height of a normal credit card. You put your
						wallet away, then pull out another device that snaps into the card using a
						very thin cable. It has a single light on it that currently shines red.</p>
					<p>You slip the card into the door's card reader, then press a button on the
						device connected by the thin cable. The light flashes rapidly for several
						seconds, then immediately stops. The color is now green meaning that the
						card reader portion of the lock will no longer be an issue.</p>
					<p>You then pull a small bag with your picking tools out of your pocket. Out of
						the bag comes two small pieces of metal. You look around to make sure that
						no one is present and take a second to listen for anyone coming down the
						hall. The coast is clear so you start picking the lock.</p>
					<p>First you remove a small cover on the bottom of the door lock plate. It
						gives access to a small locking mechanism usually only used at the factory
						where the door lock assembly was made. It's for keying or re-keying the
						lock.</p>
					<p>It takes you several minutes to get the right combination of motions to open
						the device, twice pausing for passengers coming down the hallway.</p>
					<p>Finally the lock gives way and you quickly enter a dark room with no
						lighting. Fortunately you attached a small flashlight on your cabin door key
						chain earlier in the day. With your flashlight you realize that this is a
						staircase. Looking up you can see that it winds three or four levels upward
						and an equal number of levels downward.</p>
					<p>You glimpse a glowing object of some sort catches your attention below you.
						It's the ghost so you hurry to catch up. The ghost once again slips right
						through a door two stories below where you started. You gather your breath
						preparing for anything and follow him to the door.</p>
					<p>You open the door.</p>
					<p>A large dining area unfolds before you dark except for the lights of the
						ghostly inhabitants. Hundreds of them, all moving about intermingling with
						one another sharing stories while dining on glowing transparent plates
						filled with large quantities of food.</p>
					<p>The lavishly decorated event includes a very large centerpiece formed out of
						ice in the shape of dragon standing ten feet tall and glowing as if of
						ghostly origin. Steamers from chandeliers point toward the centerpiece.
						Confetti has dropped to the floor as if bringing in a new year or some such.</p>
					<p>The stage area has acts from around the world, belly dancers, circus
						performers, and burlesque actors. You move to a corner of the room to take
						in the scene and gather your wits. You're becoming comfortable with the
						ghostly inhabitants of this ship, but en mass you get a feeling like the
						lines are very clearly delineated between the living and the undead. Being
						clearly outnumbered like this naturally disturbs you.</p>
					<p>The majority of participants are in costumes of sorts. In particular you
						notice a ghostly figure in a Minotaur outfit moving through the area
						apparently chasing two girls who run in faux terror. Several people are on
						the stage for some sort of awards presentation.</p>

					<p>You decide to head back to your cabin to grab a much needed refreshment and
						to sit and quietly think through the events leading up to Sarah's
						disappearance again. Just then you notice something out of the corner of
						your eye. You're not too surprised at this point as it is the same
						realization you had yesterday so you embrace the possibility.</p>
					<p>There is a ghost floating down the same hallway you saw it travel down
						yesterday. This time there is no David in sight, just you and the ghost in
						the hallway. It pauses and slowly looks over to you. The radiating yellow
						eyes behind the mask invoke fear yet you persist. It motions with its head
						for you to follow behind, then it continues slowly moving down the hallway.</p>
					<p>You quickly move down the hallway to the intersection and catch a glimpse of
						the ghost moving right through a closed door. After it has passed you move
						up to the door. It looks like an access door of some sort for crew members,
						there is a heavy looking lock on it.</p>
					<p>Do you pick the lock to gain access?</p>
