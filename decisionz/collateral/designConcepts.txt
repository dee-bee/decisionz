What decisionz is:
-Conditional display of content (text, music, images, videos, forwardPages)
-Conditional loading of content (text, music, images, videos, configuration files)
-Conditional interactions (masks, maps)
-Serialization of state (bookmarking)
-Multiple simultanious stages (also multiplayer sync'ing)
-Time tracking
-Routing from location to location
-Hooks for animation/transitions between scenes (classimation). The hooks call javascript functions
-Integration with other engines (such as iframes, X3Dom, D3, CSS3, Z8, etc)
-History of events, conversations, etc
-Utilities to help edit the content (wiki, JSEditor, etc)
-Demo UI as example on how to impliment engine
-Workes on a variety of devices (responsive designed) and can load to resemble a progressive web app (PWA, manifest files, fullscreen, etc)
-Debugging features (console, etc)


What decisionz is NOT:
-Menuing system -  It can be used as a menuing system, but you'll have to work hard to make this happen if you have form controls. Might be easier to do outside of the decisionz engine
